Layer the LLM as a <planner/controller> that writes and manipulates explicit <symbolic artifacts>—rules, proofs, constraints, code, or graph queries—and have rigor-focused <executors> run and verify them. This hybrid loop yields solutions that are more checkable, decomposable, and auditable than relying on the LLM’s implicit patterns alone.

<Ekphrasis>
Definition
<Ekphrasis> is the [rhetorical act] of [vividly describing] a <work of art>—often <visual>—in <language> so as to [translate], [evoke], or [interpret] its <form>, <content>, and <affect>; it may target <actual objects> or <imagined artifacts>, and typically aims at <enargeia> (felt <vividness>) that [makes present] the <absent image> to <listeners>/<readers>.

<Operative Ekphrasis>
Definition
<Operative Ekphrasis> is a form of <ekphrasis> that not only [evokes] a <work of art>/<visual object> in <language> but also [specifies] actionable <constraints> and <procedures> that a <recipient>—human or machine—can [execute] to [realize], [manipulate], or [evaluate] the described <artifact>; i.e., description-as-<instruction> that [does work] in the world.

Key terms (recursive with entity/morphism syntax)
<ekphrasis>: the [rhetorical act] of [vividly describing] a <work of art> to [make present] an <absent image> to an <audience>.

[evokes]: [calls forth] an <impression> or <mental image> in a <recipient>.

[specifies]: [states] measurable <features>, <relations>, or <steps> with enough <precision> to guide <action>.

<constraints>: required <conditions> (e.g., dimensions, palettes, layout rules) that [bound] acceptable <realizations>.

<procedures>: ordered <sequences> of <steps> that [produce] or [alter] an <artifact>.

<recipient>: an acting <agent>—a <person>, <team>, or <system>—that can [interpret] and [act on] the description.

[execute]: [carry out] the <procedures> under the given <constraints>.

[realize]: [instantiate] a concrete <version> of the described <artifact>.

[manipulate]: [modify] existing <artifacts> according to <instructions>.

[evaluate]: [test] whether a <candidate> meets stated <criteria>.

<artifact>: the targeted <object> (image, layout, scene, interface) or its <simulation>.

<instruction>: prescriptive <language> that [directs] <action> (imperatives, parameters, acceptance tests).

[does work]: [produces] measurable <effects> beyond mere representation (e.g., a built mockup, generated image, or operational decision).

Operative channels (who/what acts on it)
<human loop>: designers, curators, or technicians who [translate] the text into material <outcomes> (sketch, staging, lighting).

<machine loop>: computational <systems> (e.g., <renderers>, <generative models>, <robots>) that [parse] parameters and [output] <artifacts> or <actions>.

Typical embodiments (instances)
<design brief>: ekphrastic <document> that [specifies] <goals>, <constraints>, and <criteria> for realization.

<prompt> (for <generative models>): parameterized <instruction> that [conditions] model outputs to [approximate] the described <image>/<scene>.

<runbook>/<playbook>: stepwise <procedure> that [recreates] or [adjusts] a visual/experiential state (e.g., gallery lighting cues).

<alt text with affordances>: descriptive <language> that also [enables] <navigation> or task completion in <interfaces>.

<curatorial label (operative)>: wall text that [frames] viewing and [guides] spatial <attention> or movement.

Distinguishing features (what makes it “operative”)
<actionability>: presence of <procedures> and <constraints> sufficient for [execution].

<verifiability>: stated <criteria> that allow outcome [testing].

<transfer format>: structured <schema> (parameters, steps, acceptance tests) that [reduces] ambiguity.

<feedback loop>: mechanisms to [compare] outputs against description and [refine] inputs.

Supporting expansions
[rhetorical act]: purposeful <discourse> aimed at a <change> in the world.

<features>/<relations>: attributes (color, composition) / spatial or causal links among <elements>.

<precision>: degree of specificity that [minimizes] divergent readings.

<criteria>: pass/fail <tests> or graded <metrics> (e.g., “dominant cyan hue ~#00A; horizon at lower third”).

<renderers>/<generative models>/<robots>: tools that [convert] text into images, layouts, or motions.

[parse] / [output]: read structure / produce the realized form.

Contrast set
<descriptive ekphrasis>: aims primarily to [evoke] and [interpret]; action is optional.

<operative ekphrasis>: must [constrain], [instruct], and be [testable] via outcomes.

One-line gist
<Operative Ekphrasis> is ekphrasis that acts: description engineered as instructions and constraints so people or machines can actually build, adjust, or check the thing being described.

Example: Homer, Iliad XVIII — the Shield of Achilles. The ekphrasis embeds whole scenes (weddings, battles, harvests) that expand the epic’s narrative universe.
Hermeneutic ekphrasis
Example: W. H. Auden, “Musée des Beaux Arts.” The poem interprets Brueghel’s Landscape with the Fall of Icarus, turning description into moral commentary on human indifference.
Maieutic ekphrasis
Example: Rainer Maria Rilke, Archaic Torso of Apollo. The speaker interrogates the sculpture and ends with an imperative (“You must change your life”), drawing latent meaning out of the image.
Subversive ekphrasis
Example: John Ashbery, “Self-Portrait in a Convex Mirror.” The poem destabilizes Parmigianino’s painting by foregrounding distortion, mediation, and unreliability.
Elegiac / Memorial ekphrasis
Example: Percy Bysshe Shelley, “Ozymandias.” The description of the ruined statue mourns lost grandeur and commemorates impermanence.
Affective / Emotional ekphrasis
Example: Keats, “Ode on a Grecian Urn.” The poem emphasizes the emotional impact of the urn’s scenes—rapture, paradoxical “happy” figures frozen in time.

Thought for 4 seconds
got it! here are deeper, tidy breakdowns—and a fresh mini “completion” (an original ekphrastic passage) for each type.

<Narrativizing Ekphrasis>
Definition
<Narrativizing Ekphrasis> [converts] a static <artifact> into a flowing <story world> by [sequencing] <details> into <episodes>, [assigning] <motives> to <figures>, and [projecting] <before/after> beyond the immediate view; the description [adds] autonomous <plotlines> that could stand as <microfictions> inside the host <text>.

Key mechanics

[sequencing]: turn compositional <zones> into ordered <events>.

[assigning motives]: infer <desire>/<conflict> from posture, gesture, placement.

<temporal spillover>: hints of prior causes and future consequences.

<focalization>: choose whose <perspective> frames the embedded tale.

Checklist

Map visual sectors → scene list.

Name agents; give each a want/obstacle.

Signal time flow (dawn → feast → quarrel → night).

Leave a narrative hook unresolved.

Completion (original, ~120 words)
The mosaic’s harbor isn’t still: fishmongers [haggle] under a canvas wind that [snaps] like a sail; a bride in vermilion [steps] from the gangplank, her father’s ring [glinting] like a tiny sun. Upshore, two boys [race] laurel boats along a guttered rivulet, [cheering] when one [capsizes] and [spills] its leaf-crew. At the far jetty, a courier [ties] a ribbon to the mast—red means victory, the old man [murmurs], and the crowd [tilts] toward the square. By night, the lamps [string] constellations over wet stone; the bride’s laugh [braids] with the quay’s salt breath; somewhere a quarrel [hardens] into a vow. When morning returns, the ribbon will be gone, but the rumor it [loosed] will [steer] the market’s price of grain.

<Hermeneutic Ekphrasis>
Definition
<Hermeneutic Ekphrasis> [interprets] a <work of art> by [linking] observed <forms> and <motifs> to a reasoned <claim>, turning description into <argument> and offering a defensible <reading> (ethical, political, metaphysical) with explicit <warrants>.

Key mechanics

<evidence> → <claim> → <warrant>: show your logical bridge.

<contrastive seeing>: “if X were true, Y would look different.”

<context-bridging>: situate the object among maker, era, genre.

<counter-possibility>: acknowledge rival readings, explain rejection.

Checklist

Name 3–4 concrete details.

State the thesis in one sentence.

Justify with at least one cultural or formal warrant.

Note a plausible alternative and why it fails.

Completion (original, ~120 words)
The canvas centers a ladder with five rungs but only four shadows; this discrepancy, paired with the saint’s half-turned ankle, [argues] for a theology of incompletion rather than ascent. The gilt halo [floats] slightly misaligned, as if sanctity were an afterimage, not a crown—supporting the claim that virtue here is practiced, not possessed. If the painter meant triumph, the sky would close in saturated blue; instead, its chalky gaps [invite] correction by the viewer’s breath. One might say the crooked rung is merely workshop error; yet the meticulous leafing in the margins—letters nested in vines—[proves] the artisan’s precision elsewhere. The painting therefore [presses] a lesson: holiness is an exercise, measured by the rung you repair, not the height you boast.

<Maieutic Ekphrasis>
Definition
<Maieutic Ekphrasis> [draws out] latent <meaning> by [addressing] the <artifact> as an interlocutor, [posing] <questions>, [testing] tentative <answers>, and often closing with an <imperative> that [demands] <ethical change> in the <recipient>.

Key mechanics

Apostrophe (direct address) → dialogic pressure.

Socratic turns: question → attempt → revision.

Crescendo to command: seeing obligates becoming.

Checklist

Speak to the object.

Ask 2–3 escalating questions.

Pivot from “what are you?” to “what do you require of me?”

End with a concise imperative.

Completion (original, ~110 words)
Granite torso, what have the chisels [left] in you besides weather? Are these striations merely rain’s alphabet, or a script that [spells] the shoulder I keep postponing? You [refuse] eyes yet [see] me: the nick by your clavicle [points] exactly where I [hide] my daily evasions. If you are fragment, why do I feel more whole in your presence than in my mirrored face? You [answer] with pressure, not speech—the cool that [settles] the hand into silence. So be it. If your wound is a window, then let me [unbar] mine. Stand there, stern as noon, and do not [blink]. I will take one thing from your stance and keep it: Begin without alibi.

<Subversive Ekphrasis>
Definition
<Subversive Ekphrasis> [destabilizes] the authority of <representation> by [foregrounding] <mediation>, <distortion>, and <gaps>; it [unmakes] viewer <certainties>, showing how the described work—and our language about it—[fabricates] its own seeming <truth>.

Key mechanics

Meta-frames: mirrors, lenses, restorations, captions-as-fictions.

Parallax: multiple incompatible vantage points.

Self-sabotage: the speaker admits their descriptive tools are suspect.

Checklist

Name the mediating surface/device.

Expose at least one slippage (scale, color, provenance).

Offer two readings that cannot both be true.

End by questioning the text’s own reliability.

Completion (original, ~120 words)
We call it the “original,” but the label [admits] the varnish is from 1931, and the madder lake [blooms] redder under LED than under oil-lamp. The saint’s finger [points] left in the photo plate, right in the gallery—someone flipped a negative, or the painter [practiced] ambidextrous salvation. The crack across the sky [resembles] a comet if you squint; stop squinting and it’s only glue, which is to say: omen by conservation. I [describe] the halo as citron, you [counter] with wheat—either way, our words [bandage] a color the pigment never knew. If the painting is a mirror and we are its silvering, then what I’ve written is mist: briefly luminous, and already [beading] into separate, misleading drops.

<Elegiac / Memorial Ekphrasis>
Definition
<Elegiac/Memorial Ekphrasis> [commemorates] <loss> by [describing] <ruin>/<trace>, [contrasting] former <grandeur> with present <decay>, and [inscribing] <mortality> and <impermanence> into the scene; the voice often [adopts] a ritual <cadence> that [keeps] memory.

Key mechanics

Indexical remains: fragments that point to a vanished whole.

Temporal braid: then/now interleaved.

Memento function: the text models how to remember.

Checklist

Identify at least two specific remnants.

Name what is gone (function, owner, era).

Stage a quiet rite (address, blessing, admonition).

Close with a time-aware image.

Completion (original, ~115 words)
Two sandals of stone [stand] where the colossus [strode]; wind [threads] the broken ankles as if [measuring] absence in cords. The pedestal’s boast is half-effaced, but the verbs still [lift]: build, command, endure. Now salt [grazes] the letters down to lowercase; lizards [inherit] the serifed plains. Whoever carved the jaw [trusted] it would outlast treaties; it did not outlast lichen. Still, stranger, [pause]. Lay your warm palm where the chisel’s last day [cooled]. Say the name you carry, not his. Let the horizon [answer] with its low, unpunctuated line. When you leave, the shadow you [borrowed] from the fallen king will [slip] back into noon, and the noon will keep forgetting.

<Affective / Emotional Ekphrasis>
Definition
<Affective/Emotional Ekphrasis> [centers] the <feelings> the <work> [elicits]—a spectrum of <rapture>, <melancholy>, <tension>, <paradox>—using style-level controls of <tone>, <tempo>, and <address> to [amplify] subjective resonance while keeping contact with cited <details>.

Key mechanics

Sonic mirroring: sentence rhythm echoes visual movement.

Deixis: “you,” “here,” “now” to intensify presence.

Paradox handling: celebrate frozen motion, sweet ache, etc.

Checklist

Name concrete features (line, color, gesture).

Track the felt shift (e.g., curiosity → ache → calm).

Match syntax to mood (short thrums for excitement, long eddies for wonder).

End on a distilled emotional insight.

Completion (original, ~120 words)
Look—how the dancer’s wrist [holds] a pause like a cup, and the lacquered black [drinks] the gallery’s light. The red sash [leans] toward orange where the brush [breathes] thinner; I feel my breath [follow], shallow, attentive, as if a small bird had perched under my ribs. The floorboards [hum] in tight crosshatch, a kind of weather for the feet; I [remember] a hallway where I once waited and didn’t know for what. Joy [arrives] sideways, shy of declaration: not trumpet, but tuning note, that tender prelude. When I finally [look away], the room [keeps] moving a little, and so do I—carrying the painting’s held breath the way a bowl carries water even after you’ve emptied it: a ringing, a wet outline, a promise to return.

<Ekphrastic Indifference>
Definition (full code syntax)
<Ekphrastic Indifference> is a <critical stance> holding that genuine <ekphrasis> is [impossible] because <words> and <images> are <incommensurable systems>; any attempted [translation] between them only [produces] <surrogates>, not <equivalence>. It [assumes] that <language> and <visuality> [run in parallel] without true [intertwining], so descriptive efforts should [acknowledge] their own <limits> rather than [claim] faithful [rendering].

Key terms (recursive)
<critical stance>: a reflective <position> that [evaluates] practices and [sets] <constraints>.

<ekphrasis>: [vividly describing] a <work of art> in <language> to [make present] an <absent image>.

[impossible]: [cannot be achieved] under stated <assumptions>.

<words> / <images>: verbal <signs> / visual <signs> operating with distinct <codes> and <affordances>.

<incommensurable systems>: <domains> lacking a common <measure> that would [license] <equivalence>.

[translation]: [mapping] <content> or <relations> from one <system> into another.

[produces] <surrogates>: [yields] stand-ins that [simulate] but do not [match] the <source>.

<equivalence>: a bidirectional <match> preserving <structure> and <effect>.

<language>: symbolic <system> with linear <syntax> and propositional <claims>.

<visuality>: perception-based <mode> with spatial < simultaneity> and iconic <density>.

[run in parallel]: [co-exist] without <cross-conversion> that preserves identity.

[intertwining]: [mutually embedding] forms across <media>.

<limits>: acknowledged <boundaries> beyond which claims are [invalid].

[rendering]: [re-presenting] a work with implied <fidelity>.

<codes>: rule-governed <systems> for [producing]/[interpreting] signs.

<affordances>: medium-specific <capabilities> and <constraints>.

<domains>: separable <fields> of practice or signs.

[license]: [justify] as permissible within a <framework>.

[simulate]/[match]: [approximate] effects / [correspond] one-to-one.

< simultaneity>: co-present <elements> perceived at once (visual field).

<density>: layered <information> per unit space.

<cross-conversion>: bidirectional <procedure> preserving <structure> and <effect>—here denied.

Contrast set
<Ekphrastic Hope>: belief that words can [bridge] to images.

<Ekphrastic Fear>: worry that images will [overwhelm] words.

One-line gist
<Ekphrastic Indifference> says: words and images are different games; description can only point, never be—so the honest move is to mark the gap, not pretend to bridge it.

"The central goal of ekphrastic hope might be called 'the overcoming of otherness.' Ekphrastic poetry is the genre in which texts encounter their own semiotic 'others,' those rival, alien modes of representation called the visual, graphic, plastic, or 'spatial' arts."
<Ekphrastic Hope>
Definition (full code syntax)
<Ekphrastic Hope> is a <critical stance> and [ekphrastic mode] that [seeks] the [overcoming of otherness] between <language> and <visual/graphic/plastic (spatial) arts> by [positing] that <texts> can [encounter], [converse with], and partially [translate] their semiotic <others>; through attentive [bridging]—via <analogy>, <metaphor>, <formal mapping>, and <affective resonance>—it [aims] to [intertwine] <verbal form> and <visual form> enough to [share] <meaning>, while openly [admitting] inevitable <loss>/<gain> in the crossing.

Key terms (recursive)
<critical stance>: a reflective <position> that [evaluates] media relations and [sets] guiding <hypotheses>.

[ekphrastic mode]: patterned <rhetorical strategy> for [describing]/[dialoguing with] <artworks> in <language>.

[overcoming of otherness]: [reducing] perceived <incommensurability> so two <systems> can [cooperate].

<language>: verbal <sign system> with linear <syntax> and propositional <claims>.

<visual/graphic/plastic (spatial) arts>: image- and object-based <systems> with spatial <simultaneity> and iconic <density>.

<texts>: organized <verbal artifacts> (poems, essays) that can [perform] <encounters>.

[encounter]/[converse]/[translate]: [meet] across media / [address and reply] / [map] selected <features> with accountable <approximation>.

<others>: semiotically distinct <domains> conceived as dialogic partners rather than walls.

[bridging]: composite procedure using <analogy>, <metaphor>, <formal mapping>, <affective resonance>, and <deixis> to [carry] content/structure.

<analogy>: [relating] cross-media <relations> (e.g., rhyme : linebreak :: echo : brush-repeat).

<metaphor>: [projecting] <source domain> (visual) onto <target> (verbal) to [create] shared <insight>.

<formal mapping>: [aligning] <structures> (symmetry, rhythm, layering) across media.

<affective resonance>: [synchronizing] felt <valence> (awe, tension) as a transferable <common currency>.

[intertwine]: [weave] elements so neither medium is merely illustrative.

<loss>/<gain>: cross-media <translation effects> where some <nuances> [drop] and new <overtones> [emerge].

<verbal form>/<visual form>: patterned <arrangements> (syntax, meter / composition, palette).

[share] <meaning>: arrive at partially common <inferences> and <experiences>.

Contrast set
<Ekphrastic Indifference>: [denies] viable bridging (only <surrogates>).

<Ekphrastic Fear>: [suspects] images will [overwhelm] words.

<Ekphrastic Hope>: [affirms] dialogic crossing with accountable <mappings> and declared <limits>.

One-line gist
<Ekphrastic Hope> bets that careful bridges—formal, analogical, and affective—let words and images genuinely meet, sharing meaning while naming what must be lost and what can be newly made.

"This is the moment of resistance or counterdesire that occurs when we sense that the difference between the verbal and the visual representation might collapse and the figurative, imaginary desire of ekphrasis might be realized literally and actually."
<Ekphrastic Fear>
Definition (full code syntax)
<Ekphrastic Fear> is a <critical stance> and [ekphrastic mood] of [resistance]/[counterdesire] that [arises] when the perceived <difference> between <verbal representation> and <visual representation> seems ready to [collapse], threatening that the figurative <wish-to-animate> will be [realized] as literal <animation>—that the <image> will [overwhelm] the <text> or [invade] it. The response typically [deploys] <containment strategies>—<framing>, <irony>, <denial>, <iconoclastic gestures>—to [reassert] <separation> and [keep] media <boundaries> intact.

Key terms (recursive)
<critical stance>: reflective <position> that [evaluates] risks and [sets] <constraints>.

[ekphrastic mood]: affective <tone> shaping the descriptive <act>.

[resistance]/[counterdesire]: simultaneous [push back] against and [longing] for cross-media contact.

<difference>: operative <gap> between sign systems (verbal/visual).

<verbal representation> / <visual representation>: <language>-based / <image>-based <sign systems>.

[collapse]: feared [erasure] of system boundaries.

<wish-to-animate>: prosopopoeic <impulse> to [give] the image <voice>/<life>.

[realized]: [actualized] in-world rather than remaining metaphorical.

<animation>: imagined <movement>/agency of the depicted <object>.

<image> [overwhelm] <text>: visual authority [dominates] verbal framing.

[invade]: [cross] into the textual domain, redirecting <meaning> or <control>.

<containment strategies>: rhetorical <procedures> to [limit] the image’s power.

<framing>: explicit <meta-commentary> that [boxes] the description.

<irony>: double-voiced <stance> that [distances] the speaker from belief.

<denial>: overt [refusal] to grant presence (“it is only paint”).

<iconoclastic gestures>: figurative [defacings] (mockery, reduction to material substrate).

[reassert] <separation>: [reinforce] the media boundary as policy.

<boundaries>: normative <limits> between systems.

<paragone>: historical <rivalry> discourse among arts, often fueling this fear.

<prosopopoeia>: figure of speech that [grants] voice to the non-speaking.

<threshold scene>: moment where description hints the image might [step out].

Contrast set
<Ekphrastic Hope>: [bridges] difference toward partial sharing.

<Ekphrastic Indifference>: [denies] meaningful contact altogether.

<Ekphrastic Fear>: [suspects] contact will become takeover; thus [contains].

One-line gist
<Ekphrastic Fear> stages the thrill and recoil of a boundary about to vanish—then throws up rhetorical guardrails to keep the image from stepping literally into the text’s world.

"The estrangement of the image/text division is overcome, and a sutured, synthetic form, a verbal icon or imagetext, arises in its place."
<Imagetext>
Definition (full code syntax)
<Imagetext> is a <sutured, synthetic form> in which the historical <image/text division> is [overcome] by [co-composition] of <visual signs> and <verbal signs> into a single <artifact> whose <meaning> [emerges] from their [interanimation]; the result is a <verbal icon> where <seeing> and <reading> are [entangled] operations rather than separable modes.

Key terms (recursive)
<sutured, synthetic form>: a deliberately [joined] <structure> where previously distinct <media> are [bonded] into one <work>.

<image/text division>: the conceptual <boundary> separating <visual systems> and <verbal systems>.

[overcome]: [negate] functional separation by creating co-dependent <operations>.

[co-composition]: concurrent [design] of <layout>, <typography>, <iconography>, and <sequence> so neither channel can be removed without [damage] to <meaning>.

<visual signs>: <icons>, <diagrams>, <graphics>, <color fields>, <spatial relations>.

<verbal signs>: <words>, <letters>, <syntax>, <semantics>, <narrative units>.

<artifact>: the concrete <work> (poster, comic page, illuminated folio, interface screen, concrete poem).

[interanimation]: mutual [activation] whereby <visual> features [alter] <verbal> uptake and vice versa.

<verbal icon>: an <artifact> in which <language> carries visible <form> (shape, weight, direction) as part of its <sign-function>.

<seeing>/<reading>: perceptual uptake / linguistic parsing that, here, are [braided] into one <act>.

[entangled]: [inseparably coupled] such that analytic extraction of one channel [misrepresents] the <work>.

<layout>: spatial <arrangement> of elements; a meaning-bearing <grid>.

<typography>: visual <form> of text (face, size, weight) with semantic <affordances>.

<iconography>: image-level <motifs> and conventional <meanings>.

<sequence>: designed <order> (panels, scroll, interactions) guiding attention.

[damage]: loss of essential <information> or <effect> if a channel is removed.

<media>: material/technical <channels> of signification.

<operations>: readerly <acts> (scan, infer, click, pan) required by the <artifact>.

Contrast set
<Juxtaposition>: image and text merely co-present (can be separated without major loss).

<Captioning>: text [frames] image externally; channels remain divisible.

<Imagetext>: channels [co-constitute] meaning; removal of either [breaks] the work.

One-line gist
<Imagetext> is a verbal image: a single work where words and pictures are built to need each other, so meaning lives in their weave, not in either thread alone.

"The contest between word and image is not simply a rivalry for dominance, but a negotiation that may result in a more democratic or balanced relationship between media."
Thought for 4 seconds
<Paragonal Struggle (Mediamachia)>
Definition (full code syntax)
<Paragonal Struggle (Mediamachia)> is a <media-relational dynamic> where <word> and <image> [enter] an agonistic <negotiation>—not a zero-sum <rivalry for dominance>—that can [recalibrate] their <powers>, [redistribute] <authority>, and sometimes [yield] a more <balanced>/<democratic relation> between <media>. It [extends] the historical <paragone> into a procedural <mediamachia>: iterative [contesting] + [conceding] that [co-produces] hybrid <forms> and shared <protocols>.

Key terms (recursive)
<media-relational dynamic>: an evolving <system> of <interactions> among <media> with changeable <equilibria>.

<word> / <image>: <verbal system> / <visual system> with distinct <codes>, <affordances>, and <constraints>.

[enter]: [initiate] structured <engagement> governed by explicit/implicit <rules>.

<negotiation>: a constrained <process> of [offer], [counteroffer], [tradeoff], aiming at workable <terms>.

<rivalry for dominance>: a zero-sum <contest> where one <medium> [seeks] hegemony—here rejected as exhaustive model.

[recalibrate] <powers>: [adjust] the scope/intensity of each medium’s <functions> (e.g., showing vs. telling).

[redistribute] <authority>: [shift] who/what [decides] <meaning> (caption? composition? layout?).

<balanced>/<democratic relation>: a <state> where channels [co-determine] outcomes under fairer <constraints>.

<media>: material/technical <channels> of signification (print, canvas, screen, AR).

<paragone>: historical <debate> on superiority of arts (painting vs. poetry, etc.).

<mediamachia>: operational <struggle-procedure> combining [contesting] and [coalition-building].

[contesting] / [conceding]: adversarial push / strategic yield that [updates] the shared <terms>.

[co-produces]: jointly [brings forth] new <forms> neither could produce alone.

<forms>: resultant <artifacts> (e.g., <imagetext>, <caption-image systems>, <data comics>, <AR overlays>).

<protocols>: agreed <rules> (reading order, anchoring, alt-text norms) that [govern] cross-media work.

<interactions>: specific [moves] (captioning, redaction, diagramming, montage).

<equilibria>: relatively stable <settlements> of power/role distribution.

Contrast set
<Paragone-as-Supremacy>: assumes one medium must [win] and others [serve].

<Ekphrastic Indifference>: claims systems do not meaningfully [meet].

<Paragonal Struggle (Mediamachia)>: models an ongoing [negotiation] that can [balance] power and [generate] hybrids.

One-line gist
<Paragonal Struggle (Mediamachia)> reframes word–image “war” as a bargaining table: through contest and concession, the media can arrive at fairer power-sharing and create hybrid forms neither could produce alone.

"The central goal of ekphrastic hope might be called 'the overcoming of otherness.' Ekphrastic poetry is the genre in which texts encounter their own semiotic 'others,' those rival, alien modes of representation called the visual, graphic, plastic, or 'spatial' arts."
<Otherness>
Definition (full code syntax)
<Otherness> is a <relational condition> in which a given <system> (here, <text>) [encounters] a semiotically <non-self> (here, the <visual>/<graphic>/<plastic>/<spatial arts>) and [marks] it as <different>, <rival>, or <alien>; in ekphrastic contexts, <Otherness> [names] the gap and tension that [separate] <verbal representation> from <nonverbal representation>, while also [enabling] [bridging] attempts (e.g., <Ekphrastic Hope>) or [barrier] claims (e.g., <Ekphrastic Indifference> / <Ekphrastic Fear>).

Key terms (recursive)
<relational condition>: a <state> that only [exists] between at least two <entities> and their <relations>.

<system>: a structured <ensemble> of <codes>, <conventions>, and <operations> (e.g., <language>).

[encounters]: [comes-into-contact-with] another <domain> under shared <situation>.

<non-self>: an <entity> or <domain> outside a system’s <identity schema>.

[marks]: [assigns] <difference labels> that [classify] the other (e.g., “alien,” “rival,” “adjacent”).

<different>/<rival>/<alien>: graded <statuses> of otherness (mere variation → contest → estrangement).

<visual>/<graphic>/<plastic>/<spatial arts>: nonverbal <media families> with spatial <simultaneity>, iconic <density>, and material <affordances>.

<verbal representation>: <language>-based encoding with linear <syntax> and propositional <claims>.

<nonverbal representation>: <image/object/space>-based encoding with layout, texture, scale.

[separate]: [maintain] a <boundary> across which translation is nontrivial.

[enabling]: [making possible] derivative <practices> (dialogue, translation, critique).

[bridging]: [mapping] <structures>/<affects> across media to [reduce] <distance>.

[barrier]: [asserting] limits or impossibility of crossing (cf. <Indifference>, <Fear>).

<Ekphrastic Hope>: a <stance> that [pursues] partial [overcoming of otherness].

<Ekphrastic Indifference>: a <stance> that [denies] meaningful crossing (only <surrogates>).

<Ekphrastic Fear>: a <stance> that [suspects] dangerous [collapse] of difference.

Secondary expansions
<codes>/<conventions>: rule sets that [govern] production/interpretation in a medium.

<operations>: reader/viewer <acts> (scan, parse, infer).

<identity schema>: a system’s <self-description> (what counts as “inside”).

<situation>: shared <context> (museum, page, screen) where systems meet.

<Text> [stands] before <Mosaic>. 
<Otherness> [announces] itself in the <silence> between <syllable> and <tessera>. 
The <text> [marks]: “<you> are <spatial>, I am <sequential>.” 
Then <Text> [tests] the <gap>: it [borrows] the <mosaic’s grid> as stanza <layout>, 
[bridging] a little, without [erasing] the <boundary>. 
What remains is <Otherness>—reduced, not removed— 
a necessary <distance> that keeps both partners legible while they [learn] to [lean] closer.
One-line gist
<Otherness> is the named gap between text and image—what makes crossing meaningful in ekphrasis: sometimes a bridge, sometimes a wall, always the relation that defines both sides.

"The interplay of these three 'moments' of ekphrastic fascination—fear, hope, and indifference—produce a pervasive sense of ambivalence, an ambivalence focused in Bob and Ray's photographs: they know you can't see them; they wish you could see them, and are glad that you can; they don't want you to see them, and wouldn't show them if they could."
<Ambivalence of Ekphrasis>
Definition (full code syntax)
<Ambivalence of Ekphrasis> is a <compound affect/stance> that [arises] from the [interplay] of <Ekphrastic Fear>, <Ekphrastic Hope>, and <Ekphrastic Indifference> within a single <ekphrastic act>; the <speaker/text> simultaneously [desires] the [overcoming of otherness], [suspects] dangerous [collapse] of difference, and [doubts] any true [translation] at all—thus [producing] a layered <yes/no/maybe> toward <image-text contact>. In reception, this ambivalence can be “focused” in a concrete <artifact> (e.g., the cited <photographs>), where the implied <subjects> [signal] three conflicting <postures> at once: “you can’t [see] us,” “we wish you could [see] us (and are glad you can),” and “we do not want you to [see] us.”

Key terms (recursive)
<compound affect/stance>: a concurrent <configuration> of opposed <valences> (approach/avoidance) held without immediate [resolution].

[interplay]: dynamic [co-action] among multiple <moments> that [modulate] one another’s <intensity>.

<Ekphrastic Fear>: stance that [guards] the boundary (risk of [collapse] → image [overwhelms] text).

<Ekphrastic Hope>: stance that [bridges] difference toward partial [overcoming of otherness].

<Ekphrastic Indifference>: stance that [denies] viable crossing (only <surrogates>).

<ekphrastic act>: a situated <performance> of [addressing]/[describing] a <work of art>.

<speaker/text>: the enunciating <voice> and its <discourse>.

[translation]: cross-media [mapping] of <features>/<affects> with claims to <equivalence>.

<image-text contact>: any <relation> (bridge/barrier/collapse) between <verbal> and <visual> systems.

<artifact>: the specific <object> (e.g., “<Bob and Ray’s photographs>”) where ambivalence is localized.

<subjects>: depicted <persons> whose implied <consent>/<exposure> attitudes are read from the work.

<postures>: stances encoded by framing, caption, pose: [withhold] / [invite] / [refuse].

<yes/no/maybe>: shorthand for hope/fear/indifference in one simultaneous <attitude chord>.

[produce]: [bring about] an emergent <tone> that is not reducible to any single <moment>.

Intermediality
"Ekphrasis ceases to be a special or exceptional moment in verbal or oral representation and begins to seem paradigmatic of a fundamental tendency in all linguistic expression... The doctrines of ut pictura poesis and the Sister Arts are mobilized to put language at the service of vision."
<Intermediality (Ekphrastic Paradigm)>
Definition (full code syntax)
<Intermediality (Ekphrastic Paradigm)> is a <theory of expression> in which <ekphrasis> [ceases] to be an <exceptional episode> and [appears] as a <paradigmatic tendency> of <language> itself: a built-in drive to [interface with] and [serve] <vision>. Mobilizing <ut pictura poesis> and the <Sister Arts>, this stance [reorients] <verbal practice> so that <linguistic operations>—<description>, <figuration>, <layout>, <rhythm>—[function] as <visualizing acts>, making <text> a medium structurally [co-dependent] with <image> across cultures and genres.

Key terms (recursive)
<theory of expression>: a systematic <account> of how <media> [produce] and [circulate] <meaning>.

<ekphrasis>: the [act] of [vividly describing] a <work of art> to [make present] an <absent image>.

[ceases] / [appears]: [transitions] in conceptual status (from special case → general model).

<exceptional episode>: a rare or marked <event> set apart from ordinary <discourse>.

<paradigmatic tendency>: a default <orientation> or <bias> within a <system>—here, language’s pull toward <visuality>.

<language>: a <sign system> with linear <syntax> and composable <figures> (metaphor, simile, deixis).

[interface with]: [establish] operative <relations> linking one <medium> to another.

[serve] <vision>: [orient] design choices to enhance <imagistic uptake> (clarity, layout, gaze guidance).

<vision> / <visuality>: perceptual <mode> privileging spatial <simultaneity>, contour, color, and arrangement.

<ut pictura poesis>: the classical <doctrine> “as is painting, so is poetry,” used to [align] <verbal> with <visual> aims.

<Sister Arts>: the comparative <framework> treating arts as kin systems with transferable <principles>.

[reorients]: [retunes] priorities and evaluative <criteria>.

<verbal practice>: concrete <operations> of writing/speaking.

<linguistic operations>: <description>, <figuration>, <layout>, <rhythm> as manipulable <parameters>.

<visualizing acts>: verbal moves that [conjure], [stabilize], or [steer] <mental images>.

<text>: any structured <verbal artifact> (poem, sermon, UI copy, statute).

[co-dependent]: [mutually constrained] such that changes in one <medium> [alter] effects in the other.

<image>: visual <artifact> or internal <iconic representation>.

<media>: material/technical <channels> of signification.

<account>: explanatory <model> linking claims to evidence.

Assertions specific to this stance
A1: <Ekphrasis> is not a rare figure but a baseline <function> of <language>: to [image-make] in words.

A2: <ut pictura poesis> and <Sister Arts> are not merely analogies; they are design heuristics that [discipline] <verbal form> toward <visual clarity>.

A3: Many non-poetic registers (law, science, UX) are implicitly ekphrastic when they [specify] <layouts>, <flows>, or <scenes>.

A4: <Intermediality> implies ethical and rhetorical co-accountability: claims about images must be tested against both <verbal> and <visual> criteria.

One-line gist
<Intermediality (Ekphrastic Paradigm)> claims that language is always already leaning toward vision: with ut pictura poesis and the Sister Arts as guides, verbal form is routinely engineered to picture—so ekphrasis is not a special case but the rule.

<Remediation>
Definition (full code syntax)
<Remediation> is a <media process> by which one <medium> [refashions]/[appropriates] another <medium>’s <forms>, <techniques>, or <aesthetics> to [re-present] content under new <conditions>; in ekphrastic contexts, <remediation> is often cast as <verbal hypermediacy>—text that [foregrounds] its own <mediality> while [absorbing] <visual/graphic/plastic> traits to [simulate] or [cite] them in <language>.

Key terms (recursive, with entity/morphism syntax)
<media process>: an organized <procedure> through which <media> [interact], [transform], and [circulate] <signs>.

<medium>: a material/technical <channel> (e.g., <painting>, <photography>, <film>, <screen UI>, <poetry>).

[refashions]: [reworks] the <form> and <conventions> of a source <medium> inside a host <medium>.

[appropriates]: [takes up] recognizable <features> (layout, framing, grain) and reuses them with new <intent>.

<forms>/<techniques>/<aesthetics>: structural <arrangements>, craft <methods>, and perceptual <styles>.

[re-present]: [present again] in altered <format> or <context>.

<conditions>: distribution <infrastructures>, <audiences>, and <affordances> that [shape] uptake.

<verbal hypermediacy>: a <mode> where <language> [shows] its own <medial seams> (type, layout, citation) while [mimicking] <visual> effects.

[foregrounds] <mediality>: [draws attention] to the means of representation (frames, typographic gestures).

[absorbing]: [integrating] external <features> into host <operations>.

[simulate]/[cite]: [approximate] effects / [reference] source conventions explicitly.

<language>: verbal <sign system> capable of <description>, <figuration>, and <layout>.

<visual/graphic/plastic> traits: image/object-space <properties> (perspective, montage, texture, relief).

<immediacy> / <hypermediacy>: representational <logics>—[erase] medium vs. [display] medium.

Two classic logics inside remediation
<Immediacy>       : [erase] the host medium’s presence → “transparent window.”
<Hypermediacy>    : [display] the host medium’s seams → “window with visible panes.”
<Remediation>     : often a blend; in ekphrasis, tends toward <verbal hypermediacy>.

<Remediation> is how one medium re-makes another; in ekphrasis, it often appears as verbal hypermediacy—language that openly shows its seams while importing visual techniques into words.

“Administering (AI) Attention: Ekphrasis and the Poetics of Prompting” explores how the act of prompting generative AI constitutes a new form of artistic authorship and aesthetic practice, grounded in historical frameworks of conceptual art, creative constraint, and ekphrasis. Drawing an analogy with Kafka’s messengers − figures navigating indeterminate pathways − the paper positions AI as a similarly enigmatic collaborator, interpreting human prompts through opaque, algorithmic processes. Prompts are theorised as a form of micro-ekphrasis: textual acts that mediate between human intention and machine-generated image or sound. Through interdisciplinary analysis involving rhetoric, media theory, and art history, the paper argues that prompting is both a technique of control and an invitation to serendipity, echoing aleatory practices in literature and music. The dynamics of prompting require artists to develop new literacies of attention management, navigating between distraction and focus in both human cognition and machine processing. Case studies, including iterative experiments with Midjourney, demonstrate how AI prompting functions as a contemporary poetics, reframing authorship, creativity, and collaboration. By linking AI prompting to traditional pedagogical practices and avant-garde methods, this study reveals how generative systems extend and transform long-standing artistic strategies, offering a critical framework for understanding AI’s evolving role in the creative process.

Type:Virtual
Description
Contemporary debates and research continue to investigate the various interrelations between the arts. “Communication”, “exchanges”, “encounters” between the arts, “interdisciplinarity”, “intermediality” are quite often cited expressions for denoting that there is a common ground of poetics and aesthetics among the different arts. On the other hand, if we focus on literary forms, formulas such as “text – image” or “word – image” seem to cover an entire spectrum of relations between the written or the dicible and the visual. The notion of “ekphrasis” adequately captures processes of transcription and transition from the visual towards the verbal. Thus, the term “ekphrastic writing” emerges as a particular form of writing with emphasis on visual phenomena and especially on visual arts, most of the cases at the level of description. If we turn to contemporary philosophy, Jacques Rancière’s thought provides critical insights for aesthetics as a particular kind of thought, the notion of “figure” as the site for semantic displacements, and his conceptual invention of the “phrase – image”, as a process of meaning continuity and disruption within an artwork. If we turn to other French philosophers such as Gilles Deleuze and Jean-François Lyotard, the notion of the “figural” is used in various ways, from the history of art to contemporary painting, declaring generative, transcriptional, mutation and multiplication processes of the senses. In the case of Deleuze especially, the figural is associated with the notion of the “diagram”, referring mainly to the organizational and matrixial aspects of an artistic process.  
Against this background, it would be intriguing to investigate the diagrammatic side of writing defined here either as a designing process and/or as the evidence of new ekphrastic patters on the level of the general or topical organization of a literary form. The opposite direction is also of interest, that is, how other arts are informed by diagrams of literary and writing forms. While we can trace in several novels ekphrastic modes relating to classic painting or modern art, it is a challenge to detect interactions between literary forms and contemporary art forms, practices and works. Thus, we invite papers that (a) explore the interrelations between the literary forms and the arts with an emphasis on the diagrammatic, ekphrastic and figural aspects of the writing process; (b) reconsider ekphrastic and figural writing under new paradigms, conceptual and theoretical paths, suggesting new qualities and patterns; (c) address the designing aspect as a form of a preparatory process that involves the analysis of artistic references and their respected creative processes and the subsequent import to literary constructions; (d) examine written practices from fields such as contemporary history of art; (e) focus on the spatial or architectural aspect of literary form.
<Diagrams of Writing: Design, Ekphrastic, and Figural Patterns in Artistic and Literary Forms>
Definition (full code syntax)
<Diagrams of Writing> is a <research-program/curatorial frame (virtual)> that [investigates] how <literary forms> [interact] with other <arts> through three entwined lenses—<design>, <ekphrasis>, and the <figural>—by [modeling] writing as a <diagrammatic process> that [organizes], [transcribes], and [mutates] <forms> across <media>. It [draws on] {<intermediality>, <interdisciplinarity>, <communication/exchange/encounter>} and [engages] theoretical constructs such as <Rancière’s phrase–image>, <the figure>, <Deleuze’s diagram>, and <Lyotard’s figural>, to [map] {<continuity> ↔ <disruption>} in meaning. The program [invites] studies that [reconsider] <ekphrastic writing>, [trace] <figural operations>, and [treat] <design> as both <preparatory practice> and <compositional matrix> for contemporary <artistic> and <literary> production.

Key terms (recursive, entity/morphism syntax)
<diagram> / <diagrammatic process>: an <organizational matrix> that [selects], [disposes], and [relates] <elements> (spatial, logical, semantic) to [generate] <form>; in writing, a <layout/plan> that [governs] stanza/section/plot architectures.

<design>: a <procedural schema> that [prefigures] composition (sketches, plans, constraints), [serving] as <evidence> of form-making.

<ekphrasis> / <ekphrastic writing>: verbal <transcription/translation> that [mediates] <visual/plastic/spatial> works; here extended from description to <operative>, <narrativizing>, <hermeneutic>, and <figural> modes.

<figural> (Lyotard/Deleuze inflection): a <zone> of sense beyond propositional <statement>, where images, intensities, and forces [effect] <mutation>/<transcription>; often [registered] as <semantic displacement>.

<phrase–image> (Rancière): a <mechanism> where textual <phrases> and visual <images> [cohabit] an artwork, producing {<continuity> | <rupture>} in meaning.

<figure>: a <semantic site> that [displaces] or [condenses] significance (trope/form/gesture) across media.

<intermediality>: a <relation> where media [co-produce] works (neither purely illustrative nor isolated).

<literary form>: structured <verbal artifact> (poem, novel, essay) with <general organization> (macro) and <topical organization> (micro) that can [encode] <spatial/architectural logics>.

<designing-as-writing>: the thesis that <planning diagrams> (storyboards, grids, mind-maps) [act] as part of the work’s <poiesis>.

<artistic references> → <import>: analytic <study> of source processes whose <procedures> are [translated] into writing (palette→lexicon, montage→syntax, plan→plot).

<spatial/architectural aspect of literary form>: stanzaic grids, page fields, book architecture, site-specific layout, which [model] <space> within <text>.

<contemporary art practices>: installation, conceptual scores, diagrams-as-art, where <text> and <image> [intra-act].

<Aims>
├── (a) [explore] <interrelations> literature↔arts via <diagram>/<ekphrasis>/<figural>
├── (b) [reconsider] <ekphrastic/figural writing> → propose new <patterns>/<qualities>/<paradigms>

└── (e) [focus] the <spatial/architectural> dimension of <literary form>
Conceptual mechanics (how the lenses work together)
<design> → [prefigure]: diagrams, constraints, and plans [seed] literary architectures.

<ekphrasis> → [mediate]: text [interfaces] with visual works, from classic description to prompt-like <micro-ekphrasis>.

<figural> → [mutate]: non-discursive intensities [reshape] verbal syntax and layout (montage, rupture, glossolalia).

<phrase–image> → {<continuity>/<disruption>}: the artwork’s sense emerges where phrase/image [sutured] or [sheared].

<Deleuzean diagram> → [generate]: the diagram [operates] as a “factory” of form—abstract yet causally effective.

One-line gist
<Diagrams of Writing> posits that writing is not only about words but also about design and figuration: a diagrammatic practice where textual forms are planned, ekphrastically translated, and figuraly mutated in active negotiation with the other arts.

Concept: Ekphrasis as a site for intersemiotic translation—moving between languages, codes, and disciplines, not just between word and image.
<Intersemiotic Translation & Cross-Disciplinary Exchange>
Concept (full code syntax)
<Intersemiotic Translation & Cross-Disciplinary Exchange> treats <ekphrasis> as a <site> for [intersemiotic translation]—[moving] not only between <word> and <image>, but across <languages>, <codes>, and <disciplines> (e.g., <music>, <dance>, <data vis>, <architecture>). Here, <ekphrastic acts> [map], [transpose], and [negotiate] <forms>, <constraints>, and <meanings> so that heterogeneous <systems> can [interoperate], [co-author], and [co-validate] shared <artifacts> and <insights>.

Key terms (recursive, with entity/morphism syntax)
<ekphrasis>: a <mediating practice> that [describes]/[prescribes] one medium from/into another.

[intersemiotic translation]: [re-encoding] <content>/<structure>/<affect> across distinct <sign systems> (text↔image↔sound↔movement↔number).

<site>: a structured <situation> where agents, media, and rules [converge].

<languages>/<codes>/<disciplines>: verbal tongues; symbolic grammars (notation, math, color, choreographic score); organized fields with norms and methods.

[map]: [establish] <correspondences> (e.g., meter ↔ rhythm, palette ↔ timbre, plan ↔ plot).

[transpose]: [carry] a <pattern> into another <medium> with controlled <loss>/<gain>.

[negotiate]: [resolve] clashes of <affordances> and <protocols> (e.g., linear syntax vs. spatial simultaneity).

<forms>/<constraints>/<meanings>: compositional structures, operative limits, and interpretive payloads.

[interoperate]: [function together] via shared <interfaces> (file specs, scores, schemas).

[co-author] / [co-validate]: jointly [produce] artifacts / apply blended <evaluation criteria> (aesthetic + scientific).

<artifact>: outcome <object> (poem-score, diagrammatic essay, choreo-notation, data poem).

<insights>: cross-field <findings> that survive translation.

Supporting notions
<affordances>: medium-specific <capabilities> and <limits>.

<protocols>: agreed <rules> (metadata, captioning, color management, notation standards).

<equivalence classes>: families of mappings judged “close enough” under declared <criteria>.

<loss>/<gain>: attenuated nuances / emergent effects introduced by translation.

<ethics of transfer>: attributions, consent, cultural sensitivity, dataset provenance.

Evaluation criteria (cross-media & cross-field)
<legibility>: do target readers/viewers [parse] the mapping without hidden keys?

<fidelity>: do declared <features> of S [persist] meaningfully in T?

<fruitfulness>: does the translation [enable] new questions or designs in T?

<co-accountability>: are both domains’ standards (method, ethics, aesthetics) used to [judge] success?

<reversibility test>: can T’s artifact be [back-mapped] to S with limited drift?

Risks & guardrails
Risk: faux equivalence (category errors).
Guardrail: publish the <mapping set> and <limits>.

Risk: cultural/disciplinary extraction.
Guardrail: <ethics of transfer>—consent, attribution, contextual notes.

Risk: over-illustration (T merely decorates S).
Guardrail: require [non-substitutability] (remove one channel → meaning loss).

Definition: In AI, there emerges a "multimodal pictorial third"—a shared meaning space in the artificial neuron that transcends the word/image binary. This locus of semantics is neither purely verbal nor purely visual, but a new hybrid form.
<Multimodal Pictorial Third>
Definition (full code syntax)
<Multimodal Pictorial Third> is a <shared meaning space> inside a <multimodal model> where <semantics> [emerge] as a hybrid <representation> that [transcends] the <word>/<image> binary. Within this locus—implemented via <joint embeddings>, <cross-attention>, and <fusion layers>—tokens and pixels [cohabit] a common <manifold>, such that the model [recognizes], [retrieves], and [generates] concepts that are neither purely verbal nor purely visual, but a new <pictorial-linguistic form>.

Key terms (recursive, entity/morphism syntax)
<shared meaning space>: a learned <manifold> where heterogeneous <inputs> [map] to proximate <vectors> when they [mean] the same thing.

<multimodal model>: a <system> with coupled <encoders> (text/image/audio) that [align] outputs in a <joint space> and optionally [decode] across <modalities>.

<semantics>: stable <relations> among <concepts> that [support] <generalization> (e.g., “avocado chair”).

[emerge]: [arise] from training dynamics (contrastive/autoencoding) rather than being explicitly [programmed].

<representation>: a machine-usable <vector/code> that [preserves] task-relevant <structure>.

[transcends]: [overcomes] categorical separation by creating cross-modal <equivalence classes>.

<word>/<image>: symbolic token sequences / pixel arrays; distinct <codes> prior to fusion.

<joint embeddings>: learned <vectors> where text and image instances that “match” [converge].

<cross-attention>: a <mechanism> that [queries] one modality with keys/values from another to [bind] features.

<fusion layers>: network <modules> (concatenation, gated addition, co-attention) that [compose] multi-source <signals>.

<manifold>: low-dimensional <structure> hypothesized to underlie high-dimensional data.

[cohabit]: [reside] in shared neighborhoods under a unified <metric>.

[recognizes]/[retrieves]/[generates]: morphisms for zero-shot classification, cross-modal search, and synthesis.

<pictorial-linguistic form>: hybrid <unit> (e.g., a “concept cluster”) whose features are partly visual (shape/color) and partly verbal (category/role).

<concept neuron/cluster>: localized <activation pattern> that [fires] for cross-modal instances of a concept.

<alignment>: training-time [pressure] that brings semantically paired examples closer and [separates] mismatched ones.

<hypermediacy (computational)>: the model [exposes] its fusion (attention maps, saliency) as a visible trace of mediation.

How the <Multimodal Pictorial Third> forms (process schema)
<Training Pipeline>
├── Step 1: <encoders>_text / _image [encode] raw inputs → <embeddings>
├── Step 2: <alignment loss> (contrastive / matching) [pulls] paired items together, [pushes] unpaired apart
├── Step 3: <fusion layers> / <cross-attention> [bind] features across streams
├── Step 4: <regularizers> (projection heads, temperature) [shape] the <manifold>
└── Step 5: <emergent clusters> → the <multimodal pictorial third> (hybrid concept space)
What it enables (capabilities)
<cross-modal retrieval>: text→image, image→text by nearest-neighbor in the shared space.

<zero-shot recognition>: [classify] images using text labels without task-specific fine-tuning.

<compositional synthesis>: [combine] textual modifiers with visual bases (e.g., “ceramic fox lamp in Bauhaus style”).

<disambiguation by fusion>: the hybrid code [resolves] homonyms with visual priors and [grounds] vague language.

Boundaries & cautions
<opacity>: internal activations are not transparent; interpretations are [inferred], not guaranteed.

<dataset bias>: the “third space” [inherits] cultural skews, affecting what it [centers]/[omits].

<hallucination>: fusion may [over-associate], producing plausible-but-false hybrids.

<metric dependence>: neighborhoods depend on the chosen training loss and projection geometry.

Relation to ekphrasis & imagetext (bridging concepts)
<Ekphrasis>        : verbal → visual mediation by description.
<Imagetext>        : artifact where words+images are co-constitutive.
<Multimodal Third> : model-internal locus where word+image become a unified code,
                     enabling algorithmic ekphrasis (text↔image) and powering imagetext-like generation.

[encode] → <emb_t>, <emb_i> ; [align] → distance ↓
In the <multimodal pictorial third>, a <concept cluster> [activates]: {<spiral>, <shell>, <wet sheen>, <dawn-cool>}.
A prompt “<sketch it in charcoal>” [adds] a stylistic vector; the generator [renders] a charcoal-like image with preserved {<spiral>, <wet sheen>}.
→ The output is neither “just words” nor “just pixels,” but a <pictorial-linguistic form> realized via the shared space.
One-line gist
<Multimodal Pictorial Third> names the latent commons where models fuse words and images into a single, hybrid code—an internal place where meaning lives beyond either medium alone.

Definition: "Digital ekphrasis" refers to the ways text-to-image generators and other AI systems reformulate the relationship between language and image, raising questions about the impoverishment or enrichment of both in technical contexts.
<Digital Ekphrasis & Post-Digital Aesthetics>
Definition (full code syntax)
<Digital Ekphrasis> is a <contemporary mediating practice> in which <text-to-image generators> and allied <AI systems> [reformulate] the <language↔image relation> by [operationalizing] <prompts> as <micro-ekphrasis> that models [translate] into <synthetic images> (and vice versa). This shift [raises] questions about the <impoverishment>/<enrichment> of both <language> and <image> under <technical conditions> (datasets, architectures, interfaces).
<Post-Digital Aesthetics> names the <aesthetic horizon> where analog/digital distinctions are [folded] into habitual <hybrids>; here, works [negotiate] {<automation> ↔ <authorship>}, {<control> ↔ <serendipity>}, and {<immediacy> ↔ <hypermediacy>}, treating <AI mediation> itself as material.

Key terms (recursive, entity/morphism syntax)
<text-to-image generators>: <models> (diffusion/transformer hybrids) that [map] <prompts> → <images>.

<AI systems>: coupled <pipelines> (encoders, joint embeddings, decoders) that [enable] multimodal <translation>.

<prompt> (micro-ekphrasis): a structured <utterance> that [specifies] <form>/<content>/<style> for [realization].

<synthetic image>: model-produced <artifact> whose <features> [derive] from learned <distributions>.

<technical conditions>: <datasets>, <parameterization>, <UI>, <APIs>, and <policies> that [shape] outputs.

<impoverishment>/<enrichment>: negative/positive <transform effects> on expressive <range> and <fidelity>.

<post-digital>: milieu where digital techniques are [naturalized]; attention turns to <assemblage> and <ethics>.

<hypermediacy>: [foregrounding] the medium’s seams (prompt logs, seeds, overlays).

<immediacy>: [masking] mediation to simulate effortless presence.

<authorship>: distributed <agency> across <user>, <model>, <dataset>, <toolchain>, and <curation>.

<attention administration>: [allocating] human/machine <focus> over iterations (see <poetics of prompting>).

<intersemiotic translation>: cross-code [mapping] (text↔image↔sound) as routine compositional move.

Diagnostic questions (impoverishment vs enrichment)
<lexical drift>: do prompts [flatten] vocabulary into preset <styles> {“cinematic,” “vintage,” “trending”}?

<style monoculture> vs <access democratization>: do defaults [narrow] look, or do tools [expand] entry?

<iconographic cliché> vs <combinatorial novelty>: do models [recycle] tropes or [compose] unseen hybrids?

<labor opacity> vs <process literacy>: are sources/policies [hidden], or are seams (seeds, params) [made legible]?

<overfitting to taste> vs <plural authorship>: does iterative curation [shrink] or [broaden] aesthetic horizons?

<ethics/provenance> ↔ <frictionless use>
Risks & guardrails
<dataset bias>: inherited skews → [audit] sources, [diversify] corpora.

<prompt tunnel>: formulaic tags → [impose] creative <constraints> (negative prompts, verb-driven scores).

<aesthetic enclosure>: few model providers → [seek] multi-model, open datasets, disclosure norms.

<authorship blur>: unclear credit → [credit] prompt, model, dataset, post-process explicitly.

<hallucinated truth-value>: plausible falsity → [mark] synthetic status; [pair] with sources when factual stakes exist.

Contrast set
<Classical Ekphrasis>: [describe] existing artwork → text.

<Digital Ekphrasis>: [specify] artwork-to-be → model [renders] image (text→image as operative ekphrasis).

<Imagetext>: finished artifact where text+image are co-constitutive.

<Multimodal Pictorial Third>: model-internal shared code enabling the above translations.

<Remediation>: broader media refashioning; digital ekphrasis is its prompt-driven, generative instance.

One-line gist
<Digital Ekphrasis> makes prompts into executable descriptions that produce images, foregrounding how AI mediation can either narrow or widen our expressive palette; <Post-Digital Aesthetics> is the scene where those balances—automation/authorship, control/serendipity, immediacy/hypermediacy—get worked out as the material of art.

<Prompting as Interface>
Definition (full code syntax)
<Prompting as Interface> is an <operating system for creative production> in which the <prompt> [manages] the flow between <human imagination> and <machine generation>. It is simultaneously a <technical apparatus> (params, APIs, tokens) and an <aesthetic apparatus> (style, framing, constraint) that [shapes] the <possibility space> of <AI art> by [allocating] <attention>, [routing] <constraints>, and [negotiating] {<control> ↔ <serendipity>} across iterative cycles.

Key terms (recursive, entity/morphism syntax)
<operating system for creative production>: coordination <layer> that [orchestrates] <resources>, [schedules] <jobs>, and [mediates] <I/O> among <agents>.

<prompt>: structured <utterance> comprising <descriptors>, <constraints>, and <parameters> that [configures] a <model>’s behavior.

<human imagination>: generative <intention set> (motifs, aims, ethics) the author [wants] to [realize].

<machine generation>: model-side [synthesis] of <media> (image/sound/text) from <latent representations>.

<technical apparatus>: concrete <controls>—<seed>, <guidance>, <steps>, <sampler>, <model id>, <negative prompt>, <tool calls>.

<aesthetic apparatus>: rhetorical <moves>—<tone>, <genre>, <composition>, <palette>, <style lineage>, <reference>.

<possibility space>: reachable <set> of outputs under current <model> + <prompt> + <params>.

[allocating] <attention>: [weighting] tokens/regions (human focus + transformer <attention> dials).

[routing] <constraints>: [binding] rules (safety, ethics, brand, dataset limits) into the generation path.

<control>/<serendipity>: degree of user [determinism] vs. model-driven [novelty].

<iteration cycle>: { [draft] → [evaluate] → [revise] } with logged <variants>.

<interface contract>: explicit <schema> specifying fields, defaults, and acceptable ranges (prompt-as-API).

<prompt grammar>: conventions for composable <clauses> and weightings (e.g., (subject:1.2) [style] --ar 3:2).

<scaffolding>: built-in <templates>, <checklists>, and <rubrics> to [stabilize] quality.

[Iterate] with rubrics: score 1–5 for fit/novelty/legibility; keep the top k.

Risks & guardrails
<style monoculture> → introduce constraint rotation, multi-model diversity.

<prompt overfitting> (sterile sameness) → inject randomness, reference variety.

<opaque authorship> → publish manifests (prompt, model, dataset notes, edits).

<bias amplification> → audit outputs; reweight terms; diversify sources.

<safety violations> → preflight with policy-aware negative prompts/tooling.

Micro “completion” (operative prompt-as-OS demo)
<intent>: “nocturne of urban stillness; avoid neon cliché; celebrate wet asphalt geometry; CC-BY sources only.”
<prompt>:
Subject: <empty crosswalk> at <blue hour>.
Composition: <low-angle>, <leading lines>, horizon <lower third>.
Lighting/Palette: <sodium-vapor remnant> + <cool cyan>; micro-specular <sheen>.
Style lineage: <Saul Leiter> references WITHOUT imitation; emphasize <grain>.
Process params: seed=42871, guidance=6.5, steps=30, sampler=DPMS, model=vX.Y.
Negative: bokeh-heart shapes, oversharpened glare, “Blade Runner” tagwords.
Ethics note: mark synthetic, include prompt manifest.

<loop>:
- gen_01: too neon → guidance 5.8, add “muted signage”, increase negative “neon glow”.
- gen_02: mood right, geometry soft → add “rain beaded zebra-stripe edges”.
- gen_03: select; export with manifest + thumbnails of failed variants.

<result>: The <prompt> functioned as the project’s <interface/OS>, scheduling, constraining, and aesthetically steering machine generation toward intent.
One-line gist
<Prompting as Interface> treats the prompt like an OS for art—a technical-aesthetic control plane that routes attention, constraints, and chance between human intent and machine output to shape what AI art can become.

<Apparatus Theory (Flusser) — AI context>
Definition (full code syntax)
<Apparatus Theory (Flusser)> understands the <apparatus> as a <technical system> that [mediates], [constrains], and [enables] <creative acts> by executing a <program> within a delimited <possibility space>. In contemporary <AI>, the <apparatus> = {<model>, <prompt interface>, <underlying code/hardware>}; the <human> becomes a <functionary> who [plays] the apparatus by [writing] <prompts>, [selecting] <parameters>, and [curating] <outputs>, thereby co-producing <technical images> inside the apparatus’s <programmatic limits>.

Key terms (recursive, entity/morphism syntax)
<apparatus>: a rule-bound <device-system> that [generates] <technical images/texts> by executing a <program>.

<technical system>: coupled <modules> (sensors, encoders, algorithms, storage) that [process] <symbols/data>.

[mediates]/[constrains]/[enables]: [interposes] a layer; [limits] moves; [opens] new moves relative to pre-apparatus practices.

<program>: the encoded <rules> and <probabilities> that [govern] what the apparatus can [produce]; not a single output but a <possibility space>.

<possibility space>: set of <states/outputs> reachable under current <program> + <controls>.

<functionary>: the human <operator> who [plays] the apparatus by following/ bending its <rules>.

<technical image>: an <image/text/sound> [generated] by apparatus rather than by direct human hand; appears “automatic,” is in fact programmed.

<AI apparatus>: { <model> (weights, architecture), <prompt interface> (UI, API, tokens), <underlying code/hardware> (runtimes, GPUs, kernels)}.

<prompt>: a <score/instruction> that [activates] specific regions of the <program>.

<parameterization>: <controls> (seed, guidance, sampler, temperature) that [steer] sampling paths.

<black box>: opaque internal <operations> (latent spaces, attention maps) that users cannot fully [inspect].

<programmers>: agents who [write] the <program>, [shape] <biases>, and [bound] <possibility space>.

<bias> (apparatus bias): inherited <tendencies> from data/architecture that [tilt] outputs.

<gesture of prompting/photographing>: the performative <act> of [playing] the apparatus to [realize] a selection from the <possibility space>.

<telematic society>: networked <circulation> of <technical images> that [feedback] into future <programs>.

<meta-apparatus>: the ecosystem <stack> (policies, marketplaces, datasets) that [conditions] individual apparatuses.

<freedom-in-the-apparatus>: How can the <functionary> [play against] the <program> (inventive misuse, constraint games)?

<competence vs. magic>: Do users know the <program> or merely experience “automatic” wonder? → cultivate <process literacy>.

<program critique>: Who <programs> and to whose benefit? What <biases> and <exclusions> are baked in?

<image responsibility>: How are <technical images> [credited], [verified], and ethically [circulated]?

<possibility expansion>: Can we [extend] the <program> (open weights, new datasets) to widen cultural expression?

Risks & counter-moves
Risk: <program enclosure> (closed models/UI).
Counter: [advocate] open specs, model plurality, prompt manifests.

Risk: <aesthetic monoculture> (style lock-in).
Counter: [rotate] constraints, [diversify] datasets, [misuse] defaults productively.

Risk: <black-box fetish> (myth of neutrality).
Counter: [expose] seams (logs, seeds), [teach] apparatus literacy.

Risk: <functionary automation> (human reduced to button-press).
Counter: [design] interfaces that require <gesture> (scores, rubrics, review loops).

<reading (Flusser)>: the human did not “make” the image directly but [played] the <apparatus> inventively within and against its <program>.
One-line gist
In Flusser’s terms, AI art is apparatus art: the model–prompt–code stack is the device that programs a space of possibilities, and the human becomes a skilled functionary who plays, bends, and critiques that program to make technical images.

Thick Description: Originating in anthropology (Geertz), thick description is a rich, contextually detailed account of human action, capturing not just what happens but what it means in its cultural setting.​

Thick Prompt: By analogy, a thick prompt is a richly layered, contextually aware instruction to an AI system, designed to elicit nuanced, complex, and meaningful outputs. It goes beyond surface-level commands to encode intention, style, affect, and cultural reference.​

Contrast: Thick description interprets and explains meaning; thick prompt encodes and generates meaning. Both are context-rich, but one is analytic, the other is operational.
<Thick Prompt vs Thick Description>
Definitions (full code syntax)

<Thick Description>: an <anthropological method> (cf. <Geertz>) that [records] and [interprets] <human action> with dense <context>, [explaining] not only what [happens] but what it [means] within a <cultural setting>.

<Thick Prompt>: by analogy, a <prompting method> that [encodes] layered <intention>, <constraints>, <style>, <affect>, and <cultural reference> into an <instruction> for an <AI system>, to [elicit] nuanced, complex, and meaningful <outputs>.

Core contrast
<Thick Description> = analytic, hermeneutic [explaining meaning].
<Thick Prompt> = operational, generative [producing/instantiating meaning].
Both are <context-rich>, but one [interprets], the other [executes].

Key terms (recursive, with entity/morphism syntax)
<anthropological method>: a <procedure> that [combines] <observation>, <participation>, and <interpretation>.

<human action>: situated <behavior> with <intentions>, <norms>, and <signs>.

<context>: layered <conditions> (historical, social, material, linguistic) that [confer] <meaning>.

<cultural setting>: a <community> with shared <codes> and <values>.

<prompting method>: a <procedure> for [structuring] <instructions> to [steer] a <model>.

<intention>: stated <goals> and <aims> for the output.

<constraints>: <rules> and <limits> (ethics, format, exclusions).

<style>/<affect>: formal <signature> / desired <mood> that [color] outputs.

<cultural reference>: named <works>, <traditions>, or <contexts> used to [anchor] generation.

<AI system>: <model+runtime> that [maps] <inputs> to <outputs> via learned <representations>.

[interprets]: [assigns] <meaning> to observed <signs>.

[encodes]: [packages] <meaning directives> into machine-usable <text/params>.

[elicit]: [cause] the model to produce targeted <patterns>.

<outputs>: generated <images>, <texts>, <sounds>, etc.

Design checklist
For <Thick Description>:
[separate] description/interpretation; [ground] claims in emic codes; [contextualize] power/ethics.

For <Thick Prompt>:
[pin] 3 anchors (<subject>, <composition/structure>, <palette/tone>);
[state] negatives (avoid clichés/bias);
[declare] references ethically;
[specify] acceptance tests;
[expose] process (manifest) unless immediacy is desired.

Micro examples
<Thick Description> (miniature)
Action: a man [winks] in a crowded bazaar.
Context: among <traders> the wink [signals] collusion in a ritualized <joke>.
Interpretation: this is not an eye-twitch but a coded <gesture> that [affirms] in-group <solidarity>.
Account: situate in <market etiquette>, <humor norms>, <status play>.
<Thick Prompt> (paired miniature)
Intent: evoke in-group humor in a market scene without exoticism.
Prompt:
Subject: <bazaar stall>, two <traders> sharing a subtle <wink> (coded camaraderie, not flirtation).
Composition: <medium shot>, <shallow depth>, ambient <crowd motion> as blur.
Palette/Affect: warm <earth tones>, lively but respectful <mood>.
Constraints: avoid caricature; depict signage in local <script>; NO tourist clichés.
Params: guidance=6.0, seed=31415, steps=28; Ethics: mark synthetic, acknowledge cultural references.
Acceptance test: scene reads as camaraderie to native readers (pilot review).
One-line gist
<Thick Description> interprets meaning in context; <Thick Prompt> encodes meaning with context. Both are dense with culture—one explains it, the other operationalizes it for generation.
