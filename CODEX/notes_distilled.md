One-paragraph gist
Layer the LLM as a <planner/controller> that writes and manipulates explicit <symbolic artifacts>—rules, proofs, constraints, code, or graph queries—and have rigor-focused <executors> run and verify them. This hybrid loop yields solutions that are more checkable, decomposable, and auditable than relying on the LLM’s implicit patterns alone.

<model>: the LLM plus <system prompt>, <tools>, and <memory>.

<inputs>: <observations>, <messages>, and <history> provided to the <model>.

<constraints>: hard <limits> the <model> must obey (action schema, rate limits, red-teaming checks).

<observation>: localized <snapshot> of relevant <state> given to the LLM (fog-of-war view).

<policy>: mapping from <state> and <goals> to <action selection> (could be prompt-encoded or tool-learned).

<engine>: the <runtime> that [validates] actions and [updates] <game state>.

<world model>: structured <entities>, <relations>, and <rules> enabling [simulation].

Minimal action schema (interface the LLM must use)

<Ekphrasis>

Definition
<Ekphrasis> is the [rhetorical act] of [vividly describing] a <work of art>—often <visual>—in <language> so as to [translate], [evoke], or [interpret] its <form>, <content>, and <affect>; it may target <actual objects> or <imagined artifacts>, and typically aims at <enargeia> (felt <vividness>) that [makes present] the <absent image> to <listeners>/<readers>.

Key terms
[rhetorical act]: a purposeful <speech/writing> event that [seeks] a specific <effect> on an <audience>.

[vividly describing]: [depicting] with high <sensory detail>, <figurative language>, and <precision> to [increase] <vividness>.

<work of art>: a crafted <artifact> with organized <form> conveying <meaning> or <affect>.

<visual>: pertaining to <images>, <paintings>, <sculptures>, <architecture>, or other seen <media>.

<language>: structured <symbols> (spoken/written) used to [encode] and [communicate] <meaning>.

[translate]: [map] features of one <medium> (image) into another <medium> (words) while preserving salient <relations>.

[evoke]: [call forth] an <impression> or <emotion> in an <audience>.

[interpret]: [offer] a <reading> that [connects] <form> to <theme> or <context>.

<form>: perceivable <structure>—composition, line, color, texture—of the <artifact>.

<content>: represented <subject matter> (figures, scenes, symbols).

<affect>: felt <emotional tone> the <artifact> [elicits].

<actual objects>: existing <artworks> encountered in the world.

<imagined artifacts>: invented <objects> described as if present.

<enargeia>: classical <rhetorical quality> of [vividness] that [renders] scenes before the <mind’s eye>.

<absent image>: the non-present <visual object> that the text aims to [make present].

<listeners>/<readers>: the <audience> receiving the <discourse>.

Summary
<Ekphrasis> is words-as-paint: a crafted description that [makes] an artwork—real or imagined—[feel present] while also [interpreting] what it means and how it moves us.

---

<Operative Ekphrasis>

Definition
<Operative Ekphrasis> is a form of <ekphrasis> that not only [evokes] a <work of art>/<visual object> in <language> but also [specifies] actionable <constraints> and <procedures> that a <recipient>—human or machine—can [execute] to [realize], [manipulate], or [evaluate] the described <artifact>; i.e., description-as-<instruction> that [does work] in the world.

Key terms
<ekphrasis>: the [rhetorical act] of [vividly describing] a <work of art> to [make present] an <absent image> to an <audience>.

[evokes]: [calls forth] an <impression> or <mental image> in a <recipient>.

[specifies]: [states] measurable <features>, <relations>, or <steps> with enough <precision> to guide <action>.

<constraints>: required <conditions> (e.g., dimensions, palettes, layout rules) that [bound] acceptable <realizations>.

<procedures>: ordered <sequences> of <steps> that [produce] or [alter] an <artifact>.

<recipient>: an acting <agent>—a <person>, <team>, or <system>—that can [interpret] and [act on] the description.

[execute]: [carry out] the <procedures> under the given <constraints>.

[realize]: [instantiate] a concrete <version> of the described <artifact>.

[manipulate]: [modify] existing <artifacts> according to <instructions>.

[evaluate]: [test] whether a <candidate> meets stated <criteria>.

<artifact>: the targeted <object> (image, layout, scene, interface) or its <simulation>.

<instruction>: prescriptive <language> that [directs] <action> (imperatives, parameters, acceptance tests).

[does work]: [produces] measurable <effects> beyond mere representation (e.g., a built mockup, generated image, or operational decision).

Operative channels (who/what acts on it)
<human loop>: designers, curators, or technicians who [translate] the text into material <outcomes> (sketch, staging, lighting).

<machine loop>: computational <systems> (e.g., <renderers>, <generative models>, <robots>) that [parse] parameters and [output] <artifacts> or <actions>.

Typical embodiments (instances)
<design brief>: ekphrastic <document> that [specifies] <goals>, <constraints>, and <criteria> for realization.

<prompt> (for <generative models>): parameterized <instruction> that [conditions] model outputs to [approximate] the described <image>/<scene>.

<runbook>/<playbook>: stepwise <procedure> that [recreates] or [adjusts] a visual/experiential state (e.g., gallery lighting cues).

<alt text with affordances>: descriptive <language> that also [enables] <navigation> or task completion in <interfaces>.

<curatorial label (operative)>: wall text that [frames] viewing and [guides] spatial <attention> or movement.

Distinguishing features (what makes it “operative”)
<actionability>: presence of <procedures> and <constraints> sufficient for [execution].

<verifiability>: stated <criteria> that allow outcome [testing].

<transfer format>: structured <schema> (parameters, steps, acceptance tests) that [reduces] ambiguity.

<feedback loop>: mechanisms to [compare] outputs against description and [refine] inputs.

Supporting expansions
[rhetorical act]: purposeful <discourse> aimed at a <change> in the world.

<features>/<relations>: attributes (color, composition) / spatial or causal links among <elements>.

<precision>: degree of specificity that [minimizes] divergent readings.

<criteria>: pass/fail <tests> or graded <metrics> (e.g., “dominant cyan hue ~#00A; horizon at lower third”).

<renderers>/<generative models>/<robots>: tools that [convert] text into images, layouts, or motions.

[parse] / [output]: read structure / produce the realized form.

Summary
<Operative Ekphrasis> is ekphrasis that acts: description engineered as instructions and constraints so people or machines can actually build, adjust, or check the thing being described.

<Elegiac / Memorial Ekphrasis>

Definition
<Elegiac/Memorial Ekphrasis> is an [ekphrastic mode] that [commemorates] <loss> by [describing] <ruins>/<traces> and [contrasting] former <grandeur> with present <decay>, thereby [inscribing] <mortality>, <impermanence>, and <memory-work> into the <scene>; the voice often [adopts] a ritual <cadence> that [keeps] the <dead past> present.

Key terms
[ekphrastic mode]: patterned <rhetorical strategy> for [describing] <artworks> with <language>.

[commemorates]: [preserves] <memory> through formal <utterance>.

<loss>: absence of a prior <state> (person, power, city) that [haunts] the present.

<ruins>/<traces>: surviving <fragments> (shards, pedestals, patina) that [index] a vanished <whole>.

[contrasting]: [juxtaposing] <then> vs <now> to [highlight] change.

<grandeur>: past <magnificence> in scale, craft, or authority.

<decay>: present <erosion> (weathering, breakage, fading).

[inscribing]: [writing] thematic <values> into the <scene>.

<mortality>/<impermanence>: limits of duration applying to <beings> and <works>.

<memory-work>: deliberate <practice> of [remembering] with ethical or communal <intent>.

<scene>: the described <field> of objects, setting, and signs.

[adopts]: [assumes] a stylized <cadence>.

<cadence>: rhythmic <pattern> (anaphora, slow periods) used to [ritualize] speech.

[keeps]: [maintains] presence in absence.

<dead past>: no-longer-living <epoch> or <figure> as remembered through <trace>.

[describing]: precise naming of <materials>, <damage>, <site>.

<index>: sign that points to its cause by material connection (crack → quake).

<utterance>: spoken/written <act>.

<then> / <now>: temporal <frames> used for contrast.

<values>: thematic <meanings> (hubris, transience, warning).

[ritualize]: [shape] language to perform commemoration (invocation, blessing, admonition).

Summary
<Elegiac/Memorial Ekphrasis> is description-as-vigil: naming fragments, setting then against now, and keeping the lost present through ritual cadence and material detail.

---

<Affective / Emotional Ekphrasis>

Definition
<Affective/Emotional Ekphrasis> is an [ekphrastic mode] that [centers] the <feelings> and <moods> a <work of art> [elicits], using calibrated <tone>, <tempo>, and <address> to [amplify] subjective <rapture>, <melancholy>, <awe>, or <tension> while still [anchoring] response in named <details> of <form> and <content>; style-level choices [mirror] the work’s perceived <energy> so that emotion and description [co-evolve] on the page.

Key terms
[ekphrastic mode]: patterned <rhetorical strategy> for [describing] <artworks> with <language>.

[centers]: [puts foremost] in the discourse’s <focus>.

<feelings>/<moods>: immediate <affect> states / sustained <affective climate> shaping <perception>.

<work of art>: targeted <artifact> with organized <form> and <content>.

[elicits]: [draws out] responses in a <recipient>.

<tone>: attitude-inflected <voice> (reverent, playful, grave).

<tempo>: sentence-level <pacing> (staccato, legato) aligned to perceived <motion>.

<address>: deictic <orientation> (“you,” “here,” “now”) that [intensifies] presence.

[amplify]: [increase] salience/intensity of felt <valence>.

<rapture>/<melancholy>/<awe>/<tension>: exemplary <affects> with distinct bodily-cognitive signatures.

[anchoring]: [grounding] subjective claims in observable <details>.

<details>: specific <features> (line, color, gesture, texture) cited as <evidence>.

<form> / <content>: structural arrangement / depicted subject matter.

[mirror]: [reflect] qualities of the object in prose rhythm and sound.

<energy>: perceived dynamism (stillness, surge) of the <artifact>.

[co-evolve]: [develop] in tandem as description proceeds.

<affect>: experiential <valence> that [colors] interpretation.

<recipient>: reader/speaker undergoing the response.

<pacing>: distribution of clause lengths and pauses.

<features>: analysable aspects offered as evidence.

Summary
<Affective/Emotional Ekphrasis> is description tuned to feeling: it [mirrors] a work’s energy in tone and tempo, [anchors] emotion in detail, and [distills] how form becomes felt experience.

---

<Ekphrastic Indifference>

Definition
<Ekphrastic Indifference> is a <critical stance> holding that genuine <ekphrasis> is [impossible] because <words> and <images> are <incommensurable systems>; any attempted [translation] between them only [produces] <surrogates>, not <equivalence>. It [assumes] that <language> and <visuality> [run in parallel] without true [intertwining], so descriptive efforts should [acknowledge] their own <limits> rather than [claim] faithful [rendering].

Key terms
<critical stance>: a reflective <position> that [evaluates] practices and [sets] <constraints>.

<ekphrasis>: [vividly describing] a <work of art> in <language> to [make present] an <absent image>.

[impossible]: [cannot be achieved] under stated <assumptions>.

<words> / <images>: verbal <signs> / visual <signs> operating with distinct <codes> and <affordances>.

<incommensurable systems>: <domains> lacking a common <measure> that would [license] <equivalence>.

[translation]: [mapping] <content> or <relations> from one <system> into another.

[produces] <surrogates>: [yields] stand-ins that [simulate] but do not [match] the <source>.

<equivalence>: a bidirectional <match> preserving <structure> and <effect>.

<language>: symbolic <system> with linear <syntax> and propositional <claims>.

<visuality>: perception-based <mode> with spatial < simultaneity> and iconic <density>.

[run in parallel]: [co-exist] without <cross-conversion> that preserves identity.

[intertwining]: [mutually embedding] forms across <media>.

<limits>: acknowledged <boundaries> beyond which claims are [invalid].

[rendering]: [re-presenting] a work with implied <fidelity>.

<codes>: rule-governed <systems> for [producing]/[interpreting] signs.

<affordances>: medium-specific <capabilities> and <constraints>.

<domains>: separable <fields> of practice or signs.

[license]: [justify] as permissible within a <framework>.

[simulate]/[match]: [approximate] effects / [correspond] one-to-one.

< simultaneity>: co-present <elements> perceived at once (visual field).

<density>: layered <information> per unit space.

<cross-conversion>: bidirectional <procedure> preserving <structure> and <effect>—here denied.

Summary
<Ekphrastic Indifference> says: words and images are different games; description can only point, never be—so the honest move is to mark the gap, not pretend to bridge it.

---

<Ekphrastic Hope>

Definition
<Ekphrastic Hope> is a <critical stance> and [ekphrastic mode] that [seeks] the [overcoming of otherness] between <language> and <visual/graphic/plastic (spatial) arts> by [positing] that <texts> can [encounter], [converse with], and partially [translate] their semiotic <others>; through attentive [bridging]—via <analogy>, <metaphor>, <formal mapping>, and <affective resonance>—it [aims] to [intertwine] <verbal form> and <visual form> enough to [share] <meaning>, while openly [admitting] inevitable <loss>/<gain> in the crossing.

Key terms
<critical stance>: a reflective <position> that [evaluates] media relations and [sets] guiding <hypotheses>.

[ekphrastic mode]: patterned <rhetorical strategy> for [describing]/[dialoguing with] <artworks> in <language>.

[overcoming of otherness]: [reducing] perceived <incommensurability> so two <systems> can [cooperate].

<language>: verbal <sign system> with linear <syntax> and propositional <claims>.

<visual/graphic/plastic (spatial) arts>: image- and object-based <systems> with spatial <simultaneity> and iconic <density>.

<texts>: organized <verbal artifacts> (poems, essays) that can [perform] <encounters>.

[encounter]/[converse]/[translate]: [meet] across media / [address and reply] / [map] selected <features> with accountable <approximation>.

<others>: semiotically distinct <domains> conceived as dialogic partners rather than walls.

[bridging]: composite procedure using <analogy>, <metaphor>, <formal mapping>, <affective resonance>, and <deixis> to [carry] content/structure.

<analogy>: [relating] cross-media <relations> (e.g., rhyme : linebreak :: echo : brush-repeat).

<metaphor>: [projecting] <source domain> (visual) onto <target> (verbal) to [create] shared <insight>.

<formal mapping>: [aligning] <structures> (symmetry, rhythm, layering) across media.

<affective resonance>: [synchronizing] felt <valence> (awe, tension) as a transferable <common currency>.

[intertwine]: [weave] elements so neither medium is merely illustrative.

<loss>/<gain>: cross-media <translation effects> where some <nuances> [drop] and new <overtones> [emerge].

<verbal form>/<visual form>: patterned <arrangements> (syntax, meter / composition, palette).

[share] <meaning>: arrive at partially common <inferences> and <experiences>.

Summary
<Ekphrastic Hope> bets that careful bridges—formal, analogical, and affective—let words and images genuinely meet, sharing meaning while naming what must be lost and what can be newly made.

---

<Ekphrastic Fear>

Definition
<Ekphrastic Fear> is a <critical stance> and [ekphrastic mood] of [resistance]/[counterdesire] that [arises] when the perceived <difference> between <verbal representation> and <visual representation> seems ready to [collapse], threatening that the figurative <wish-to-animate> will be [realized] as literal <animation>—that the <image> will [overwhelm] the <text> or [invade] it. The response typically [deploys] <containment strategies>—<framing>, <irony>, <denial>, <iconoclastic gestures>—to [reassert] <separation> and [keep] media <boundaries> intact.

Key terms
<critical stance>: reflective <position> that [evaluates] risks and [sets] <constraints>.

[ekphrastic mood]: affective <tone> shaping the descriptive <act>.

[resistance]/[counterdesire]: simultaneous [push back] against and [longing] for cross-media contact.

<difference>: operative <gap> between sign systems (verbal/visual).

<verbal representation> / <visual representation>: <language>-based / <image>-based <sign systems>.

[collapse]: feared [erasure] of system boundaries.

<wish-to-animate>: prosopopoeic <impulse> to [give] the image <voice>/<life>.

[realized]: [actualized] in-world rather than remaining metaphorical.

<animation>: imagined <movement>/agency of the depicted <object>.

<image> [overwhelm] <text>: visual authority [dominates] verbal framing.

[invade]: [cross] into the textual domain, redirecting <meaning> or <control>.

<containment strategies>: rhetorical <procedures> to [limit] the image’s power.

<framing>: explicit <meta-commentary> that [boxes] the description.

<irony>: double-voiced <stance> that [distances] the speaker from belief.

<denial>: overt [refusal] to grant presence (“it is only paint”).

<iconoclastic gestures>: figurative [defacings] (mockery, reduction to material substrate).

[reassert] <separation>: [reinforce] the media boundary as policy.

<boundaries>: normative <limits> between systems.

<paragone>: historical <rivalry> discourse among arts, often fueling this fear.

<prosopopoeia>: figure of speech that [grants] voice to the non-speaking.

<threshold scene>: moment where description hints the image might [step out].

Summary
<Ekphrastic Fear> stages the thrill and recoil of a boundary about to vanish—then throws up rhetorical guardrails to keep the image from stepping literally into the text’s world.

---

<Imagetext>

Definition
<Imagetext> is a <sutured, synthetic form> in which the historical <image/text division> is [overcome] by [co-composition] of <visual signs> and <verbal signs> into a single <artifact> whose <meaning> [emerges] from their [interanimation]; the result is a <verbal icon> where <seeing> and <reading> are [entangled] operations rather than separable modes.

Key terms
<sutured, synthetic form>: a deliberately [joined] <structure> where previously distinct <media> are [bonded] into one <work>.

<image/text division>: the conceptual <boundary> separating <visual systems> and <verbal systems>.

[overcome]: [negate] functional separation by creating co-dependent <operations>.

[co-composition]: concurrent [design] of <layout>, <typography>, <iconography>, and <sequence> so neither channel can be removed without [damage] to <meaning>.

<visual signs>: <icons>, <diagrams>, <graphics>, <color fields>, <spatial relations>.

<verbal signs>: <words>, <letters>, <syntax>, <semantics>, <narrative units>.

<artifact>: the concrete <work> (poster, comic page, illuminated folio, interface screen, concrete poem).

[interanimation]: mutual [activation] whereby <visual> features [alter] <verbal> uptake and vice versa.

<verbal icon>: an <artifact> in which <language> carries visible <form> (shape, weight, direction) as part of its <sign-function>.

<seeing>/<reading>: perceptual uptake / linguistic parsing that, here, are [braided] into one <act>.

[entangled]: [inseparably coupled] such that analytic extraction of one channel [misrepresents] the <work>.

<layout>: spatial <arrangement> of elements; a meaning-bearing <grid>.

<typography>: visual <form> of text (face, size, weight) with semantic <affordances>.

<iconography>: image-level <motifs> and conventional <meanings>.

<sequence>: designed <order> (panels, scroll, interactions) guiding attention.

[damage]: loss of essential <information> or <effect> if a channel is removed.

<media>: material/technical <channels> of signification.

<operations>: readerly <acts> (scan, infer, click, pan) required by the <artifact>.

Summary
<Imagetext> is a verbal image: a single work where words and pictures are built to need each other, so meaning lives in their weave, not in either thread alone.

---

<Paragonal Struggle (Mediamachia)>

Definition
<Paragonal Struggle (Mediamachia)> is a <media-relational dynamic> where <word> and <image> [enter] an agonistic <negotiation>—not a zero-sum <rivalry for dominance>—that can [recalibrate] their <powers>, [redistribute] <authority>, and sometimes [yield] a more <balanced>/<democratic relation> between <media>. It [extends] the historical <paragone> into a procedural <mediamachia>: iterative [contesting] + [conceding] that [co-produces] hybrid <forms> and shared <protocols>.

Key terms
<media-relational dynamic>: an evolving <system> of <interactions> among <media> with changeable <equilibria>.

<word> / <image>: <verbal system> / <visual system> with distinct <codes>, <affordances>, and <constraints>.

[enter]: [initiate] structured <engagement> governed by explicit/implicit <rules>.

<negotiation>: a constrained <process> of [offer], [counteroffer], [tradeoff], aiming at workable <terms>.

<rivalry for dominance>: a zero-sum <contest> where one <medium> [seeks] hegemony—here rejected as exhaustive model.

[recalibrate] <powers>: [adjust] the scope/intensity of each medium’s <functions> (e.g., showing vs. telling).

[redistribute] <authority>: [shift] who/what [decides] <meaning> (caption? composition? layout?).

<balanced>/<democratic relation>: a <state> where channels [co-determine] outcomes under fairer <constraints>.

<media>: material/technical <channels> of signification (print, canvas, screen, AR).

<paragone>: historical <debate> on superiority of arts (painting vs. poetry, etc.).

<mediamachia>: operational <struggle-procedure> combining [contesting] and [coalition-building].

[contesting] / [conceding]: adversarial push / strategic yield that [updates] the shared <terms>.

[co-produces]: jointly [brings forth] new <forms> neither could produce alone.

<forms>: resultant <artifacts> (e.g., <imagetext>, <caption-image systems>, <data comics>, <AR overlays>).

<protocols>: agreed <rules> (reading order, anchoring, alt-text norms) that [govern] cross-media work.

<interactions>: specific [moves] (captioning, redaction, diagramming, montage).

<equilibria>: relatively stable <settlements> of power/role distribution.

Summary
<Paragonal Struggle (Mediamachia)> reframes word–image “war” as a bargaining table: through contest and concession, the media can arrive at fairer power-sharing and create hybrid forms neither could produce alone.

---

<Otherness>

Definition
<Otherness> is a <relational condition> in which a given <system> (here, <text>) [encounters] a semiotically <non-self> (here, the <visual>/<graphic>/<plastic>/<spatial arts>) and [marks] it as <different>, <rival>, or <alien>; in ekphrastic contexts, <Otherness> [names] the gap and tension that [separate] <verbal representation> from <nonverbal representation>, while also [enabling] [bridging] attempts (e.g., <Ekphrastic Hope>) or [barrier] claims (e.g., <Ekphrastic Indifference> / <Ekphrastic Fear>).

Key terms
<relational condition>: a <state> that only [exists] between at least two <entities> and their <relations>.

<system>: a structured <ensemble> of <codes>, <conventions>, and <operations> (e.g., <language>).

[encounters]: [comes-into-contact-with] another <domain> under shared <situation>.

<non-self>: an <entity> or <domain> outside a system’s <identity schema>.

[marks]: [assigns] <difference labels> that [classify] the other (e.g., “alien,” “rival,” “adjacent”).

<different>/<rival>/<alien>: graded <statuses> of otherness (mere variation → contest → estrangement).

<visual>/<graphic>/<plastic>/<spatial arts>: nonverbal <media families> with spatial <simultaneity>, iconic <density>, and material <affordances>.

<verbal representation>: <language>-based encoding with linear <syntax> and propositional <claims>.

<nonverbal representation>: <image/object/space>-based encoding with layout, texture, scale.

[separate]: [maintain] a <boundary> across which translation is nontrivial.

[enabling]: [making possible] derivative <practices> (dialogue, translation, critique).

[bridging]: [mapping] <structures>/<affects> across media to [reduce] <distance>.

[barrier]: [asserting] limits or impossibility of crossing (cf. <Indifference>, <Fear>).

<Ekphrastic Hope>: a <stance> that [pursues] partial [overcoming of otherness].

<Ekphrastic Indifference>: a <stance> that [denies] meaningful crossing (only <surrogates>).

<Ekphrastic Fear>: a <stance> that [suspects] dangerous [collapse] of difference.

Summary
<Otherness> is the named gap between text and image—what makes crossing meaningful in ekphrasis: sometimes a bridge, sometimes a wall, always the relation that defines both sides.

---

<Ambivalence of Ekphrasis>

Definition
<Ambivalence of Ekphrasis> is a <compound affect/stance> that [arises] from the [interplay] of <Ekphrastic Fear>, <Ekphrastic Hope>, and <Ekphrastic Indifference> within a single <ekphrastic act>; the <speaker/text> simultaneously [desires] the [overcoming of otherness], [suspects] dangerous [collapse] of difference, and [doubts] any true [translation] at all—thus [producing] a layered <yes/no/maybe> toward <image-text contact>. In reception, this ambivalence can be “focused” in a concrete <artifact> (e.g., the cited <photographs>), where the implied <subjects> [signal] three conflicting <postures> at once: “you can’t [see] us,” “we wish you could [see] us (and are glad you can),” and “we do not want you to [see] us.”

Key terms
<compound affect/stance>: a concurrent <configuration> of opposed <valences> (approach/avoidance) held without immediate [resolution].

[interplay]: dynamic [co-action] among multiple <moments> that [modulate] one another’s <intensity>.

<Ekphrastic Fear>: stance that [guards] the boundary (risk of [collapse] → image [overwhelms] text).

<Ekphrastic Hope>: stance that [bridges] difference toward partial [overcoming of otherness].

<Ekphrastic Indifference>: stance that [denies] viable crossing (only <surrogates>).

<ekphrastic act>: a situated <performance> of [addressing]/[describing] a <work of art>.

<speaker/text>: the enunciating <voice> and its <discourse>.

[translation]: cross-media [mapping] of <features>/<affects> with claims to <equivalence>.

<image-text contact>: any <relation> (bridge/barrier/collapse) between <verbal> and <visual> systems.

<artifact>: the specific <object> (e.g., “<Bob and Ray’s photographs>”) where ambivalence is localized.

<subjects>: depicted <persons> whose implied <consent>/<exposure> attitudes are read from the work.

<postures>: stances encoded by framing, caption, pose: [withhold] / [invite] / [refuse].

<yes/no/maybe>: shorthand for hope/fear/indifference in one simultaneous <attitude chord>.

[produce]: [bring about] an emergent <tone> that is not reducible to any single <moment>.

One-line gist
<Ambivalence of Ekphrasis> is the simultaneous come closer / stay back / nothing crosses anyway that emerges when hope, fear, and indifference cohabit a single act of looking-and-saying.

​

Intermediality
"Ekphrasis ceases to be a special or exceptional moment in verbal or oral representation and begins to seem paradigmatic of a fundamental tendency in all linguistic expression... The doctrines of ut pictura poesis and the Sister Arts are mobilized to put language at the service of vision."

Summary
<Ambivalence of Ekphrasis> is the simultaneous come closer / stay back / nothing crosses anyway that emerges when hope, fear, and indifference cohabit a single act of looking-and-saying.

<Intermediality (Ekphrastic Paradigm)>

Definition
<Intermediality (Ekphrastic Paradigm)> is a <theory of expression> in which <ekphrasis> [ceases] to be an <exceptional episode> and [appears] as a <paradigmatic tendency> of <language> itself: a built-in drive to [interface with] and [serve] <vision>. Mobilizing <ut pictura poesis> and the <Sister Arts>, this stance [reorients] <verbal practice> so that <linguistic operations>—<description>, <figuration>, <layout>, <rhythm>—[function] as <visualizing acts>, making <text> a medium structurally [co-dependent] with <image> across cultures and genres.

Key terms
<theory of expression>: a systematic <account> of how <media> [produce] and [circulate] <meaning>.

<ekphrasis>: the [act] of [vividly describing] a <work of art> to [make present] an <absent image>.

[ceases] / [appears]: [transitions] in conceptual status (from special case → general model).

<exceptional episode>: a rare or marked <event> set apart from ordinary <discourse>.

<paradigmatic tendency>: a default <orientation> or <bias> within a <system>—here, language’s pull toward <visuality>.

<language>: a <sign system> with linear <syntax> and composable <figures> (metaphor, simile, deixis).

[interface with]: [establish] operative <relations> linking one <medium> to another.

[serve] <vision>: [orient] design choices to enhance <imagistic uptake> (clarity, layout, gaze guidance).

<vision> / <visuality>: perceptual <mode> privileging spatial <simultaneity>, contour, color, and arrangement.

<ut pictura poesis>: the classical <doctrine> “as is painting, so is poetry,” used to [align] <verbal> with <visual> aims.

<Sister Arts>: the comparative <framework> treating arts as kin systems with transferable <principles>.

[reorients]: [retunes] priorities and evaluative <criteria>.

<verbal practice>: concrete <operations> of writing/speaking.

<linguistic operations>: <description>, <figuration>, <layout>, <rhythm> as manipulable <parameters>.

<visualizing acts>: verbal moves that [conjure], [stabilize], or [steer] <mental images>.

<text>: any structured <verbal artifact> (poem, sermon, UI copy, statute).

[co-dependent]: [mutually constrained] such that changes in one <medium> [alter] effects in the other.

<image>: visual <artifact> or internal <iconic representation>.

<media>: material/technical <channels> of signification.

<account>: explanatory <model> linking claims to evidence.

Assertions specific to this stance
A1: <Ekphrasis> is not a rare figure but a baseline <function> of <language>: to [image-make] in words.

A2: <ut pictura poesis> and <Sister Arts> are not merely analogies; they are design heuristics that [discipline] <verbal form> toward <visual clarity>.

A3: Many non-poetic registers (law, science, UX) are implicitly ekphrastic when they [specify] <layouts>, <flows>, or <scenes>.

A4: <Intermediality> implies ethical and rhetorical co-accountability: claims about images must be tested against both <verbal> and <visual> criteria.

Summary
<Intermediality (Ekphrastic Paradigm)> claims that language is always already leaning toward vision: with ut pictura poesis and the Sister Arts as guides, verbal form is routinely engineered to picture—so ekphrasis is not a special case but the rule.

<Remediation>

Definition
<Remediation> is a <media process> by which one <medium> [refashions]/[appropriates] another <medium>’s <forms>, <techniques>, or <aesthetics> to [re-present] content under new <conditions>; in ekphrastic contexts, <remediation> is often cast as <verbal hypermediacy>—text that [foregrounds] its own <mediality> while [absorbing] <visual/graphic/plastic> traits to [simulate] or [cite] them in <language>.

Key terms
<media process>: an organized <procedure> through which <media> [interact], [transform], and [circulate] <signs>.

<medium>: a material/technical <channel> (e.g., <painting>, <photography>, <film>, <screen UI>, <poetry>).

[refashions]: [reworks] the <form> and <conventions> of a source <medium> inside a host <medium>.

[appropriates]: [takes up] recognizable <features> (layout, framing, grain) and reuses them with new <intent>.

<forms>/<techniques>/<aesthetics>: structural <arrangements>, craft <methods>, and perceptual <styles>.

[re-present]: [present again] in altered <format> or <context>.

<conditions>: distribution <infrastructures>, <audiences>, and <affordances> that [shape] uptake.

<verbal hypermediacy>: a <mode> where <language> [shows] its own <medial seams> (type, layout, citation) while [mimicking] <visual> effects.

[foregrounds] <mediality>: [draws attention] to the means of representation (frames, typographic gestures).

[absorbing]: [integrating] external <features> into host <operations>.

define Administering (AI) Attention: Ekphrasis and the Poetics of Prompting
Rolf Hughes
EIT Culture & Creativity
“Administering (AI) Attention: Ekphrasis and the Poetics of Prompting” explores how the act of prompting generative AI constitutes a new form of artistic authorship and aesthetic practice, grounded in historical frameworks of conceptual art, creative constraint, and ekphrasis. Drawing an analogy with Kafka’s messengers − figures navigating indeterminate pathways − the paper positions AI as a similarly enigmatic collaborator, interpreting human prompts through opaque, algorithmic processes. Prompts are theorised as a form of micro-ekphrasis: textual acts that mediate between human intention and machine-generated image or sound. Through interdisciplinary analysis involving rhetoric, media theory, and art history, the paper argues that prompting is both a technique of control and an invitation to serendipity, echoing aleatory practices in literature and music. The dynamics of prompting require artists to develop new literacies of attention management, navigating between distraction and focus in both human cognition and machine processing. Case studies, including iterative experiments with Midjourney, demonstrate how AI prompting functions as a contemporary poetics, reframing authorship, creativity, and collaboration. By linking AI prompting to traditional pedagogical practices and avant-garde methods, this study reveals how generative systems extend and transform long-standing artistic strategies, offering a critical framework for understanding AI’s evolving role in the creative process.

<Administering (AI) Attention: Ekphrasis and the Poetics of Prompting>

Definition
<Administering (AI) Attention: Ekphrasis and the Poetics of Prompting> is a <theoretical-creative framework> (by <Rolf Hughes>, <EIT Culture & Creativity> ) that [argues] <AI prompting> is a contemporary <poetics>: prompts are <micro-ekphrasis> that [mediate] between <human intention> and <generative system> outputs, [administering] joint <attention> while [balancing] {<control> ↔ <serendipity>}. Drawing on <conceptual art>, <creative constraint>, and <aleatory practice>, and analogizing <AI> to <Kafka’s messengers> (an enigmatic <collaborator> that [interprets] through <opaque algorithmic processes>), the framework [reframes] <authorship>, <creativity>, and <collaboration> as iterative, intermedial <procedures> evidenced by case studies (e.g., <Midjourney> experiments).

Key terms
<theoretical-creative framework>: an integrated <account> that [links] <concepts>, <methods>, and <cases> to guide <practice>.

<AI prompting>: the [act] of [specifying] <instructions> to a <generative system> to [condition] produced <media> (image/sound/text).

<poetics>: a <principle-set> that [explains] and [shapes] how <artworks> are [made] and [received] (here: via prompts).

<micro-ekphrasis>: concise <verbal scenes> that [depict]/[prescribe] target <qualities> so a machine [renders]/[approximates] them.

<conceptual art>: practice where <instruction> and <idea> [constitute] the <work>, informing prompt-as-score.

<creative constraint>: designed <limits> (rules, forms) that [catalyze] unexpected <solutions>.

<aleatory practice>: method that [invites] <chance> (dice, cut-ups) to co-author results; here mirrored by model randomness.

<Kafka’s messengers> (analogy): figures who [navigate] indeterminate <paths> while [carrying] ambiguous <messages>; maps to AI’s opaque traversal.

<opaque algorithmic processes>: internal <operations> (sampling, attention weights) that users cannot [inspect] directly.

<authorship>: distributed <agency> across <prompt>, <model>, <dataset>, <toolchain>, and iterative <selection>.

<collaboration>: reciprocal <workflow> in which human and system [propose]/[respond]/[revise] toward a shared <artifact>.

<literacies of attention management>: user <competences> for [focusing], [filtering], [iterating], and [timing] prompts and reviews.

<rhetoric> / <media theory> / <art history>: analytic <lenses> that [situate] prompting within traditions of <persuasion>, <mediation>, and <practice>.

<Midjourney> (case): a <generative image platform> used to [demonstrate] iterative prompting as <poetic method>.

<pedagogical practices>: instructional <formats> (studio critique, exercises) that [train] prompting as a <craft>.

Supporting expansions
<prompt>: a structured <utterance> with <descriptors>, <constraints>, and sometimes <parameters> ([weights], [seeds], [styles]).

<attention>: {<human>: selective <cognition>; <machine>: transformer <mechanism>} that [weights] tokens/features.

<iteration loop>: { [draft] → [inspect] → [revise] } repeated with logged <variants>.

Summary
The study treats prompting as micro-ekphrasis and attention management: a craft that steers opaque, generative collaborators between control and chance, renewing conceptual-art strategies and reshaping authorship in the age of AI.

<Diagrams of Writing: Design, Ekphrastic, and Figural Patterns in Artistic and Literary Forms>

Definition
<Diagrams of Writing> is a <research-program/curatorial frame (virtual)> that [investigates] how <literary forms> [interact] with other <arts> through three entwined lenses—<design>, <ekphrasis>, and the <figural>—by [modeling] writing as a <diagrammatic process> that [organizes], [transcribes], and [mutates] <forms> across <media>. It [draws on] {<intermediality>, <interdisciplinarity>, <communication/exchange/encounter>} and [engages] theoretical constructs such as <Rancière’s phrase–image>, <the figure>, <Deleuze’s diagram>, and <Lyotard’s figural>, to [map] {<continuity> ↔ <disruption>} in meaning. The program [invites] studies that [reconsider] <ekphrastic writing>, [trace] <figural operations>, and [treat] <design> as both <preparatory practice> and <compositional matrix> for contemporary <artistic> and <literary> production.

Key terms
<diagram> / <diagrammatic process>: an <organizational matrix> that [selects], [disposes], and [relates] <elements> (spatial, logical, semantic) to [generate] <form>; in writing, a <layout/plan> that [governs] stanza/section/plot architectures.

<design>: a <procedural schema> that [prefigures] composition (sketches, plans, constraints), [serving] as <evidence> of form-making.

<ekphrasis> / <ekphrastic writing>: verbal <transcription/translation> that [mediates] <visual/plastic/spatial> works; here extended from description to <operative>, <narrativizing>, <hermeneutic>, and <figural> modes.

<figural> (Lyotard/Deleuze inflection): a <zone> of sense beyond propositional <statement>, where images, intensities, and forces [effect] <mutation>/<transcription>; often [registered] as <semantic displacement>.

<phrase–image> (Rancière): a <mechanism> where textual <phrases> and visual <images> [cohabit] an artwork, producing {<continuity> | <rupture>} in meaning.

<figure>: a <semantic site> that [displaces] or [condenses] significance (trope/form/gesture) across media.

<intermediality>: a <relation> where media [co-produce] works (neither purely illustrative nor isolated).

<literary form>: structured <verbal artifact> (poem, novel, essay) with <general organization> (macro) and <topical organization> (micro) that can [encode] <spatial/architectural logics>.

<designing-as-writing>: the thesis that <planning diagrams> (storyboards, grids, mind-maps) [act] as part of the work’s <poiesis>.

<artistic references> → <import>: analytic <study> of source processes whose <procedures> are [translated] into writing (palette→lexicon, montage→syntax, plan→plot).

<spatial/architectural aspect of literary form>: stanzaic grids, page fields, book architecture, site-specific layout, which [model] <space> within <text>.

<contemporary art practices>: installation, conceptual scores, diagrams-as-art, where <text> and <image> [intra-act].

Program aims mapped to the call (a–e)
<Aims>
├── (a) [explore] <interrelations> literature↔arts via <diagram>/<ekphrasis>/<figural>
├── (b) [reconsider] <ekphrastic/figural writing> → propose new <patterns>/<qualities>/<paradigms>
├── (c) [address] <designing aspect> as <preparatory process> → analyze sources & [import] procedures
├── (d) [examine] written practices from <contemporary art history> (scores, wall texts, catalogs, diagrams)
└── (e) [focus] the <spatial/architectural> dimension of <literary form>
Conceptual mechanics (how the lenses work together)
<design> → [prefigure]: diagrams, constraints, and plans [seed] literary architectures.

<ekphrasis> → [mediate]: text [interfaces] with visual works, from classic description to prompt-like <micro-ekphrasis>.

<figural> → [mutate]: non-discursive intensities [reshape] verbal syntax and layout (montage, rupture, glossolalia).

<phrase–image> → {<continuity>/<disruption>}: the artwork’s sense emerges where phrase/image [sutured] or [sheared].

<Deleuzean diagram> → [generate]: the diagram [operates] as a “factory” of form—abstract yet causally effective.

Summary
<Diagrams of Writing> posits that writing is not only about words but also about design and figuration: a diagrammatic practice where textual forms are planned, ekphrastically translated, and figuraly mutated in active negotiation with the other arts.

<Multimodal Pictorial Third>

Definition
<Multimodal Pictorial Third> is a <shared meaning space> inside a <multimodal model> where <semantics> [emerge] as a hybrid <representation> that [transcends] the <word>/<image> binary. Within this locus—implemented via <joint embeddings>, <cross-attention>, and <fusion layers>—tokens and pixels [cohabit] a common <manifold>, such that the model [recognizes], [retrieves], and [generates] concepts that are neither purely verbal nor purely visual, but a new <pictorial-linguistic form>.

Key terms
<shared meaning space>: a learned <manifold> where heterogeneous <inputs> [map] to proximate <vectors> when they [mean] the same thing.

<multimodal model>: a <system> with coupled <encoders> (text/image/audio) that [align] outputs in a <joint space> and optionally [decode] across <modalities>.

<semantics>: stable <relations> among <concepts> that [support] <generalization> (e.g., “avocado chair”).

[emerge]: [arise] from training dynamics (contrastive/autoencoding) rather than being explicitly [programmed].

<representation>: a machine-usable <vector/code> that [preserves] task-relevant <structure>.

[transcends]: [overcomes] categorical separation by creating cross-modal <equivalence classes>.

<word>/<image>: symbolic token sequences / pixel arrays; distinct <codes> prior to fusion.

<joint embeddings>: learned <vectors> where text and image instances that “match” [converge].

<cross-attention>: a <mechanism> that [queries] one modality with keys/values from another to [bind] features.

<fusion layers>: network <modules> (concatenation, gated addition, co-attention) that [compose] multi-source <signals>.

<manifold>: low-dimensional <structure> hypothesized to underlie high-dimensional data.

[cohabit]: [reside] in shared neighborhoods under a unified <metric>.

[recognizes]/[retrieves]/[generates]: morphisms for zero-shot classification, cross-modal search, and synthesis.

<pictorial-linguistic form>: hybrid <unit> (e.g., a “concept cluster”) whose features are partly visual (shape/color) and partly verbal (category/role).

<concept neuron/cluster>: localized <activation pattern> that [fires] for cross-modal instances of a concept.

<alignment>: training-time [pressure] that brings semantically paired examples closer and [separates] mismatched ones.

<hypermediacy (computational)>: the model [exposes] its fusion (attention maps, saliency) as a visible trace of mediation.

How the <Multimodal Pictorial Third> forms (process schema)
<Training Pipeline>
├── Step 1: <encoders>_text / _image [encode] raw inputs → <embeddings>
├── Step 2: <alignment loss> (contrastive / matching) [pulls] paired items together, [pushes] unpaired apart
├── Step 3: <fusion layers> / <cross-attention> [bind] features across streams
├── Step 4: <regularizers> (projection heads, temperature) [shape] the <manifold>
└── Step 5: <emergent clusters> → the <multimodal pictorial third> (hybrid concept space)
What it enables (capabilities)
<cross-modal retrieval>: text→image, image→text by nearest-neighbor in the shared space.

<zero-shot recognition>: [classify] images using text labels without task-specific fine-tuning.

<compositional synthesis>: [combine] textual modifiers with visual bases (e.g., “ceramic fox lamp in Bauhaus style”).

<disambiguation by fusion>: the hybrid code [resolves] homonyms with visual priors and [grounds] vague language.

Boundaries & cautions
<opacity>: internal activations are not transparent; interpretations are [inferred], not guaranteed.

<dataset bias>: the “third space” [inherits] cultural skews, affecting what it [centers]/[omits].

<hallucination>: fusion may [over-associate], producing plausible-but-false hybrids.

<metric dependence>: neighborhoods depend on the chosen training loss and projection geometry.

Relation to ekphrasis & imagetext (bridging concepts)
<Ekphrasis>        : verbal → visual mediation by description.
<Imagetext>        : artifact where words+images are co-constitutive.
<Multimodal Third> : model-internal locus where word+image become a unified code,
                     enabling algorithmic ekphrasis (text↔image) and powering imagetext-like generation.

<Digital Ekphrasis & Post-Digital Aesthetics>

Definition
<Digital Ekphrasis> is a <contemporary mediating practice> in which <text-to-image generators> and allied <AI systems> [reformulate] the <language↔image relation> by [operationalizing] <prompts> as <micro-ekphrasis> that models [translate] into <synthetic images> (and vice versa). This shift [raises] questions about the <impoverishment>/<enrichment> of both <language> and <image> under <technical conditions> (datasets, architectures, interfaces). <Post-Digital Aesthetics> names the <aesthetic horizon> where analog/digital distinctions are [folded] into habitual <hybrids>; here, works [negotiate] {<automation> ↔ <authorship>}, {<control> ↔ <serendipity>}, and {<immediacy> ↔ <hypermediacy>}, treating <AI mediation> itself as material.

Key terms
<text-to-image generators>: <models> (diffusion/transformer hybrids) that [map] <prompts> → <images>.

<AI systems>: coupled <pipelines> (encoders, joint embeddings, decoders) that [enable] multimodal <translation>.

<prompt> (micro-ekphrasis): a structured <utterance> that [specifies] <form>/<content>/<style> for [realization].

<synthetic image>: model-produced <artifact> whose <features> [derive] from learned <distributions>.

<technical conditions>: <datasets>, <parameterization>, <UI>, <APIs>, and <policies> that [shape] outputs.

<impoverishment>/<enrichment>: negative/positive <transform effects> on expressive <range> and <fidelity>.

<post-digital>: milieu where digital techniques are [naturalized]; attention turns to <assemblage> and <ethics>.

<hypermediacy>: [foregrounding] the medium’s seams (prompt logs, seeds, overlays).

<immediacy>: [masking] mediation to simulate effortless presence.

<authorship>: distributed <agency> across <user>, <model>, <dataset>, <toolchain>, and <curation>.

<attention administration>: [allocating] human/machine <focus> over iterations (see <poetics of prompting>).

<intersemiotic translation>: cross-code [mapping] (text↔image↔sound) as routine compositional move.

Diagnostic questions (impoverishment vs enrichment)
<lexical drift>: do prompts [flatten] vocabulary into preset <styles> {“cinematic,” “vintage,” “trending”}?

<style monoculture> vs <access democratization>: do defaults [narrow] look, or do tools [expand] entry?

<iconographic cliché> vs <combinatorial novelty>: do models [recycle] tropes or [compose] unseen hybrids?

<labor opacity> vs <process literacy>: are sources/policies [hidden], or are seams (seeds, params) [made legible]?

<overfitting to taste> vs <plural authorship>: does iterative curation [shrink] or [broaden] aesthetic horizons?

Summary
<Digital Ekphrasis> makes prompts into executable descriptions that produce images, foregrounding how AI mediation can either narrow or widen our expressive palette; <Post-Digital Aesthetics> is the scene where those balances—automation/authorship, control/serendipity, immediacy/hypermediacy—get worked out as the material of art.

<Prompting as Interface>

Definition
<Prompting as Interface> is an <operating system for creative production> in which the <prompt> [manages] the flow between <human imagination> and <machine generation>. It is simultaneously a <technical apparatus> (params, APIs, tokens) and an <aesthetic apparatus> (style, framing, constraint) that [shapes] the <possibility space> of <AI art> by [allocating] <attention>, [routing] <constraints>, and [negotiating] {<control> ↔ <serendipity>} across iterative cycles.

Key terms
<operating system for creative production>: coordination <layer> that [orchestrates] <resources>, [schedules] <jobs>, and [mediates] <I/O> among <agents>.

<possibility space>: reachable <set> of outputs under current <model> + <prompt> + <params>.

[allocating] <attention>: [weighting] tokens/regions (human focus + transformer <attention> dials).

Interface patterns (design idioms)
<score pattern>: prompt as <composition score> with sections (subject/composition/light/process/ethics).

<spec pattern>: prompt as formal <requirement spec> with MUST/SHOULD/NOT clauses.

<brief pattern>: prompt as creative <brief> (audience, mood, refs, success metrics).

<dialogic pattern>: multi-turn <negotiation> where the prompt [evolves] via critique.

<ensemble pattern>: meta-prompt [routes] to multiple <models>; [merges] outputs.

Heuristics (practical)
[Pin] 3 anchors: <subject>, <composition>, <lighting/palette>.

[State] limits: <negative prompt> for clichés/undesirables.

[Balance] C↔S: guidance (C) vs. stochasticity/seed jitter (S).

[Expose] seams: log seeds/params for reproducibility (hypermediacy) unless immediacy is the aim.

[Ethics] first: consent, provenance, safety policies; embed in the prompt.

[Iterate] with rubrics: score 1–5 for fit/novelty/legibility; keep the top k.

Risks & guardrails
<style monoculture> → introduce constraint rotation, multi-model diversity.

<prompt overfitting> (sterile sameness) → inject randomness, reference variety.

<opaque authorship> → publish manifests (prompt, model, dataset notes, edits).

<bias amplification> → audit outputs; reweight terms; diversify sources.

<safety violations> → preflight with policy-aware negative prompts/tooling.

Summary
<Prompting as Interface> treats the prompt like an OS for art—a technical-aesthetic control plane that routes attention, constraints, and chance between human intent and machine output to shape what AI art can become.

<Apparatus Theory (Flusser) — AI context>

Definition
<Apparatus Theory (Flusser)> understands the <apparatus> as a <technical system> that [mediates], [constrains], and [enables] <creative acts> by executing a <program> within a delimited <possibility space>. In contemporary <AI>, the <apparatus> = {<model>, <prompt interface>, <underlying code/hardware>}; the <human> becomes a <functionary> who [plays] the apparatus by [writing] <prompts>, [selecting] <parameters>, and [curating] <outputs>, thereby co-producing <technical images> inside the apparatus’s <programmatic limits>.

Key terms
<apparatus>: a rule-bound <device-system> that [generates] <technical images/texts> by executing a <program>.

<technical system>: coupled <modules> (sensors, encoders, algorithms, storage) that [process] <symbols/data>.

[mediates]/[constrains]/[enables]: [interposes] a layer; [limits] moves; [opens] new moves relative to pre-apparatus practices.

<program>: the encoded <rules> and <probabilities> that [govern] what the apparatus can [produce]; not a single output but a <possibility space>.

<possibility space>: set of <states/outputs> reachable under current <program> + <controls>.

<functionary>: the human <operator> who [plays] the apparatus by following/ bending its <rules>.

<technical image>: an <image/text/sound> [generated] by apparatus rather than by direct human hand; appears “automatic,” is in fact programmed.

<AI apparatus>: { <model> (weights, architecture), <prompt interface> (UI, API, tokens), <underlying code/hardware> (runtimes, GPUs, kernels)}.

<prompt>: a <score/instruction> that [activates] specific regions of the <program>.

<parameterization>: <controls> (seed, guidance, sampler, temperature) that [steer] sampling paths.

<black box>: opaque internal <operations> (latent spaces, attention maps) that users cannot fully [inspect].

<programmers>: agents who [write] the <program>, [shape] <biases>, and [bound] <possibility space>.

<bias> (apparatus bias): inherited <tendencies> from data/architecture that [tilt] outputs.

<gesture of prompting/photographing>: the performative <act> of [playing] the apparatus to [realize] a selection from the <possibility space>.

<telematic society>: networked <circulation> of <technical images> that [feedback] into future <programs>.

<meta-apparatus>: the ecosystem <stack> (policies, marketplaces, datasets) that [conditions] individual apparatuses.

AI mapping (Flusser → present stack)
<camera>              → <model> (diffusion/LLM)
<shutter/gesture>     → <prompt> + <parameters>
<film/program>        → <weights/dataset/architecture>
<darkroom>            → <sampler/scheduler/post-process>
<photographer=functionary> → <prompt author/curator>
<technical image>     → <synthetic image/text/sound>
Process schema (how creation happens in the apparatus)
<Apparatus Creation Loop>
├── Step 1: [frame] intent (the <functionary> formulates aims/ethics)
├── Step 2: [compose] <prompt> + <parameters> (playable score)
├── Step 3: <apparatus> [executes] <program> → [samples] from <possibility space>
├── Step 4: <functionary> [selects]/[edits]/[curates] <technical images>
├── Step 5: Outputs [re-enter] the <telematic society> (platforms/feeds)
└── Step 6: Feedback [updates] the <meta-apparatus> (datasets, styles, norms)
Normative questions (Flusserian diagnostics for AI)
<freedom-in-the-apparatus>: How can the <functionary> [play against] the <program> (inventive misuse, constraint games)?

<competence vs. magic>: Do users know the <program> or merely experience “automatic” wonder? → cultivate <process literacy>.

<program critique>: Who <programs> and to whose benefit? What <biases> and <exclusions> are baked in?

<image responsibility>: How are <technical images> [credited], [verified], and ethically [circulated]?

<possibility expansion>: Can we [extend] the <program> (open weights, new datasets) to widen cultural expression?

Risks & counter-moves
Risk: <program enclosure> (closed models/UI).
Counter: [advocate] open specs, model plurality, prompt manifests.

Risk: <aesthetic monoculture> (style lock-in).
Counter: [rotate] constraints, [diversify] datasets, [misuse] defaults productively.

Risk: <black-box fetish> (myth of neutrality).
Counter: [expose] seams (logs, seeds), [teach] apparatus literacy.

Risk: <functionary automation> (human reduced to button-press).
Counter: [design] interfaces that require <gesture> (scores, rubrics, review loops).

Summary
In Flusser’s terms, AI art is apparatus art: the model–prompt–code stack is the device that programs a space of possibilities, and the human becomes a skilled functionary who plays, bends, and critiques that program to make technical images.
