        "completion": "The mosaic’s harbor isn’t still: fishmongers [haggle] under a canvas wind that [snaps] like a sail; a bride in vermilion [steps] from the gangplank, her father’s ring [glinting] like a tiny sun. Upshore, two boys [race] laurel boats along a guttered rivulet, [cheering] when one [capsizes] and [spills] its leaf-crew. At the far jetty, a courier [ties] a ribbon to the mast—red means victory, the old man [murmurs], and the crowd [tilts] toward the square. By night, the lamps [string] constellations over wet stone; the bride’s laugh [braids] with the quay’s salt breath; somewhere a quarrel [hardens] into a vow. When morning returns, the ribbon will be gone, but the rumor it [loosed] will [steer] the market’s price of grain.\n\n<Hermeneutic Ekphrasis>\nDefinition\n<Hermeneutic Ekphrasis> [interprets] a <work of art> by [linking] observed <forms> and <motifs> to a reasoned <claim>, turning description into <argument> and offering a defensible <reading> (ethical, political, metaphysical) with explicit <warrants>.\n\nKey mechanics\n\n<evidence> → <claim> → <warrant>: show your logical bridge.\n\n<contrastive seeing>: “if X were true, Y would look different.”\n\n<context-bridging>: situate the object among maker, era, genre.\n\n<counter-possibility>: acknowledge rival readings, explain rejection.\n\nChecklist\n\nName 3–4 concrete details.\n\nState the thesis in one sentence.\n\nJustify with at least one cultural or formal warrant.\n\nNote a plausible alternative and why it fails.\n\nCompletion (original, ~120 words)\nThe canvas centers a ladder with five rungs but only four shadows; this discrepancy, paired with the saint’s half-turned ankle, [argues] for a theology of incompletion rather than ascent. The gilt halo [floats] slightly misaligned, as if sanctity were an afterimage, not a crown—supporting the claim that virtue here is practiced, not possessed. If the painter meant triumph, the sky would close in saturated blue; instead, its chalky gaps [invite] correction by the viewer’s breath. One might say the crooked rung is merely workshop error; yet the meticulous leafing in the margins—letters nested in vines—[proves] the artisan’s precision elsewhere. The painting therefore [presses] a lesson: holiness is an exercise, measured by the rung you repair, not the height you boast.\n\n<Maieutic Ekphrasis>\nDefinition\n<Maieutic Ekphrasis> [draws out] latent <meaning> by [addressing] the <artifact> as an interlocutor, [posing] <questions>, [testing] tentative <answers>, and often closing with an <imperative> that [demands] <ethical change> in the <recipient>.\n\nKey mechanics\n\nApostrophe (direct address) → dialogic pressure.\n\nSocratic turns: question → attempt → revision.\n\nCrescendo to command: seeing obligates becoming.\n\nChecklist\n\nSpeak to the object.\n\nAsk 2–3 escalating questions.\n\nPivot from “what are you?” to “what do you require of me?”\n\nEnd with a concise imperative.\n\nCompletion (original, ~110 words)\nGranite torso, what have the chisels [left] in you besides weather? Are these striations merely rain’s alphabet, or a script that [spells] the shoulder I keep postponing? You [refuse] eyes yet [see] me: the nick by your clavicle [points] exactly where I [hide] my daily evasions. If you are fragment, why do I feel more whole in your presence than in my mirrored face? You [answer] with pressure, not speech—the cool that [settles] the hand into silence. So be it. If your wound is a window, then let me [unbar] mine. Stand there, stern as noon, and do not [blink]. I will take one thing from your stance and keep it: Begin without alibi.\n\n<Subversive Ekphrasis>\nDefinition\n<Subversive Ekphrasis> [destabilizes] the authority of <representation> by [foregrounding] <mediation>, <distortion>, and <gaps>; it [unmakes] viewer <certainties>, showing how the described work—and our language about it—[fabricates] its own seeming <truth>.\n\nKey mechanics\n\nMeta-frames: mirrors, lenses, restorations, captions-as-fictions.\n\nParallax: multiple incompatible vantage points.\n\nSelf-sabotage: the speaker admits their descriptive tools are suspect.\n\nChecklist\n\nName the mediating surface/device.\n\nExpose at least one slippage (scale, color, provenance).\n\nOffer two readings that cannot both be true.\n\nEnd by questioning the text’s own reliability.\n\nCompletion (original, ~120 words)\nWe call it the “original,” but the label [admits] the varnish is from 1931, and the madder lake [blooms] redder under LED than under oil-lamp. The saint’s finger [points] left in the photo plate, right in the gallery—someone flipped a negative, or the painter [practiced] ambidextrous salvation. The crack across the sky [resembles] a comet if you squint; stop squinting and it’s only glue, which is to say: omen by conservation. I [describe] the halo as citron, you [counter] with wheat—either way, our words [bandage] a color the pigment never knew. If the painting is a mirror and we are its silvering, then what I’ve written is mist: briefly luminous, and already [beading] into separate, misleading drops.\n\n<Elegiac / Memorial Ekphrasis>\nDefinition\n<Elegiac/Memorial Ekphrasis> [commemorates] <loss> by [describing] <ruin>/<trace>, [contrasting] former <grandeur> with present <decay>, and [inscribing] <mortality> and <impermanence> into the scene; the voice often [adopts] a ritual <cadence> that [keeps] memory.\n\nKey mechanics\n\nIndexical remains: fragments that point to a vanished whole.\n\nTemporal braid: then/now interleaved.\n\nMemento function: the text models how to remember.\n\nChecklist\n\nIdentify at least two specific remnants.\n\nName what is gone (function, owner, era).\n\nStage a quiet rite (address, blessing, admonition).\n\nClose with a time-aware image.\n\nCompletion (original, ~115 words)\nTwo sandals of stone [stand] where the colossus [strode]; wind [threads] the broken ankles as if [measuring] absence in cords. The pedestal’s boast is half-effaced, but the verbs still [lift]: build, command, endure. Now salt [grazes] the letters down to lowercase; lizards [inherit] the serifed plains. Whoever carved the jaw [trusted] it would outlast treaties; it did not outlast lichen. Still, stranger, [pause]. Lay your warm palm where the chisel’s last day [cooled]. Say the name you carry, not his. Let the horizon [answer] with its low, unpunctuated line. When you leave, the shadow you [borrowed] from the fallen king will [slip] back into noon, and the noon will keep forgetting.\n\n<Affective / Emotional Ekphrasis>\nDefinition\n<Affective/Emotional Ekphrasis> [centers] the <feelings> the <work> [elicits]—a spectrum of <rapture>, <melancholy>, <tension>, <paradox>—using style-level controls of <tone>, <tempo>, and <address> to [amplify] subjective resonance while keeping contact with cited <details>.\n\nKey mechanics\n\nSonic mirroring: sentence rhythm echoes visual movement.\n\nDeixis: “you,” “here,” “now” to intensify presence.\n\nParadox handling: celebrate frozen motion, sweet ache, etc.\n\nChecklist\n\nName concrete features (line, color, gesture).\n\nTrack the felt shift (e.g., curiosity → ache → calm).\n\nMatch syntax to mood (short thrums for excitement, long eddies for wonder).\n\nEnd on a distilled emotional insight.\n\nCompletion (original, ~120 words)\nLook—how the dancer’s wrist [holds] a pause like a cup, and the lacquered black [drinks] the gallery’s light. The red sash [leans] toward orange where the brush [breathes] thinner; I feel my breath [follow], shallow, attentive, as if a small bird had perched under my ribs. The floorboards [hum] in tight crosshatch, a kind of weather for the feet; I [remember] a hallway where I once waited and didn’t know for what. Joy [arrives] sideways, shy of declaration: not trumpet, but tuning note, that tender prelude. When I finally [look away], the room [keeps] moving a little, and so do I—carrying the painting’s held breath the way a bowl carries water even after you’ve emptied it: a ringing, a wet outline, a promise to return."
